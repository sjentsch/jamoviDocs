============
jamovi and R
============

There are a few ways to use jamovi and R together. The first is to use of the `Rj Editor <Rj_overview.html>`__, a module available from the jamovi library that allows executing R code from within jamovi.

Another is to use the :doc:`jmv R package <jmv_overview>` which makes all the analyses included with jamovi available from an interactive R session (such as in RStudio). jamovi can also provide the equivalent R syntax for each analysis with :doc:`Syntax mode <um_6_syntax_mode>`.

.. To learn more about R you can use two excellent websites by `Danielle J. Navarro <https://djnavarro.net>`__. The first is `«Learning statistics with R» <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>`__ and has psychology students who use R in their first method course as the main target group. On this page you will find a `PDF <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf>`__ and a `bookdown <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/>`__ version that was the basis for «Learning statistics with jamovi» (which is availble both as `web documentation <https://lsj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lsj/Prologue.html>`__ as well as `textbook in PDF format <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__). The second resource, `R for Psychological Science <https://psyr.org>`__, is still under construction and more aimed at someone who already has taken at least one research method class and would like to learn how to use the R programming language in their own work. This site also has a strong focus on the `tidyverse methodology <https://www.tidyverse.org>`__ of `Hadley Wickham <http://hadley.nz>`__.
