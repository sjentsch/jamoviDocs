Combining jamovi and R
======================

A huge advantage of jamovi is that it is not only built on top of the R
statistical language, it also makes it also very easy to access R from jamovi,
and jamovi from R. The syntax mode, ``Rj``, |jmvconnect| and |jmvReadWrite| help
you to achieve that.

Syntax Mode
-----------

   jamovi provides an “R Syntax Mode”, in this mode, jamovi produces equivalent
   R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select the application
   menu (⋮) at the top right of jamovi, and check the ``Syntax mode`` checkbox
   there. It is possible to leave syntax mode by clicking this a second time.

   In syntax mode, analyses continue to operate as before, but now they produce
   R syntax. Like all results objects in jamovi, you can right click on these
   items (including the R syntax) and copy and paste them, for example, into an
   R session. All the analyses that are included with jamovi are available
   within an R session through the R package :doc:`jmv <../jmv/jmv_overview>`.

      <div class="gif-player" data-anim-src="../_static/gifs/um_rSyntax.gif" data-static-src="../_static/gifs/um_rSyntax.png"></div>

   The provided R syntax does not include the data import step, but this can be
   easily achieved by using the R packages |jmvconnect|_ and |jmvReadWrite|_
   (explained in more detail below). |jmvReadWrite|_ enables you to read and
   write jamovi data files (.omv) in R, |jmvconnect|_ permits you to access
   data sets that you have opened in your jamovi session from R.

.. _rj_editor:

``Rj`` Editor
-------------

   The ``Rj Editor`` allows you to use ``R`` code to analyse data directly in
   jamovi, and make use of your favourite R packages from within jamovi. ``Rj``
   is a module for jamovi (see :doc:`../howto/howto_Install_modules`) that
   allows you to use the R programming language to analyse data from within
   jamovi.

   |um_Rj1|

   There are many reasons you might want to do this; there are a lot of
   analyses available in R packages that haven’t (yet) been made available as
   jamovi modules, and ``Rj`` allows you to make use of these analyses from
   within jamovi. Additionally, you can make use of loops and if-statements,
   allowing (among other things) conditional analyses and simulation studies.

   For some, using R in a spreadsheet will be an ideal place to begin learning
   ``R``. For others, it can be an easy way to share R analyses with less
   technically savvy colleagues (and some people just prefer to code).

   To run an R analysis, select ``Rj Editor`` from the ``R``-icon in the
   ``Analyses`` ribbon. This will bring up the editor for entering your ``R``
   code. The data set you have opened in jamovi is available to you as a data
   frame, simply as ``data``. To get started, you might like to run
   ``descriptives`` on it.

   |um_Rj2|

   Or if you prefer the ``dplyr`` approach, you could go:

   .. code-block:: R

      library(jmv)
      library(dplyr)
      library(magrittr)
      
      select(data, 1:3) %>% descriptives()

   You’ll notice as you’re entering this code, ``Rj`` auto-suggests function
   names. To run the code, click on the green triangle or press Control +
   Shift + Enter (or ⌘ + Shift + Enter if you’re on a Mac). jamovi will run
   the ``R`` code and the results will appear in the results panel like other
   analyses. You can continue to make changes to the code, and then run it
   again.

   By default, ``Rj`` makes use of the version of ``R`` bundled with jamovi.
   This includes many packages (|jmv|_ and all it’s dependencies), and will be
   sufficient for many people, but if you need to make use of additional R
   packages then you’ll need to make use of the ``System R`` version. If you
   select ⚙ (at the top right of the code box), you’ll see an option to change
   the ``R version`` used. The ``System R`` version uses the version of ``R``
   you have installed on your system. This has the advantage that your ``R``
   code now has access to all of the packages you have installed for that
   version of ``R``. The last thing you will need is to have the |jmvconnect|_
   R package installed in the R library on your system.

``jmvconnect`` R package
------------------------

   The |jmvconnect|_ R package allows the ``R`` version on your system to access
   the data sets that you opened in jamovi. You can install it in ``R`` with:

   .. code-block:: R

      install.packages('jmvconnect')

   Once this is done, moving from the ``jamovi R`` to the ``System R`` should
   be seamless.

   It’s worth remembering that sharing jamovi files with colleagues becomes a
   bit more complicated when you make use of the ``System R`` version. If they
   want to make changes and re-run your analyses, they will need to have the
   same R packages installed – that’s the price of flexibility!

   When ``Rj`` runs ``R`` code, by default it makes the whole data set
   available as a data frame called ``data``. However, it’s likely that your
   analysis only makes use of a few columns, and doesn’t need the whole data
   set. You can limit the columns made available to the analysis by including
   a special comment at the top of your script, of the form:

   .. code-block:: R

      # (column1, column2, column3)
      
      library(jmv)
      
      ...

   In this instance, only the named columns will appear in the data data frame.
   This can speed the analysis up, particularly if you are working with large
   data sets. Additionally, this lets jamovi know that the analysis is only
   using these columns, and the analysis will not need to be re-run if changes
   are made to other columns.

   There may be times where you’ll want to transition to an R session for
   analysing a data set. This is where the |jmvconnect|_ R package comes in
   handy. |jmvconnect|_ lets you read the data sets from a running jamovi
   instance into an R session. It has two functions: ``what()`` lists the
   available data sets, and ``read()`` reads them. For example, you might use:

   .. code-block:: R

      > library(jmvconnect)
      > what()
      
       Available Data Sets
       ─────────────────────────────────────
               Title           Rows    Cols   
       ─────────────────────────────────────
          1    iris             150       5   
          2    Tooth Growth      60       3   
       ─────────────────────────────────────

   and then read the data set with either of these two commands:

   .. code-block:: R

      data <- read('Tooth Growth')
      data <- read(2)


``jmvReadWrite`` R package
--------------------------

   The |jmvReadWrite|_ R package reads and writes jamovi-data-files (.omv) in
   ``R``. It can be installed with:

   .. code-block:: R

      install.packages('jmvReadWrite')

   
   A typical use case would be if you wanted to process a large number
   of result files (e.g., CSV-files from several participants in an experiment
   or with responses from different questionnaires). Wrangling data is often
   easiest achieved in R. Once you have assembled your dataset from these
   files, you can write it using the ``write_omv()``-function.

   .. code-block:: R

      library(jmvReadWrite)

      # assemble your data set (named dtaSet)...

      write_omv(dtaSet, "FILENAME.omv")

   
   Likewise does the ``read_omv``-function permit you to read jamovi-data-files
   into ``R``. Another typical use case would be reading a data file, doing
   manipulations that currently are not possible in jamovi, and then writing
   back the resulting modified file (in the jamovi file format).

   .. code-block:: R

      library(jmvReadWrite)

      dtaSet <- read_omv("FILENAME.omv")

      # do some modifications to your data set

      write_omv(dtaSet, "FILENAME.omv")


   There is a couple of helper functions implemented in |jmvReadWrite|_. They
   enable operations such as re-arranging the columns / variables of a data set
   (``arrange_cols_omv``), mass-converting a data files into the jamovi file
   format (``convert_to_omv``; e.g. from a statistics software that you used
   earlier), converting data files from long to wide format (``long2wide_omv``)
   and from wide to long format (``wide2long_omv``), adding variables from
   several data sets (``merge_cols_omv``), adding cases from several data sets
   (``merge_rows_omv``), or sort a data set after one or more variables
   (``sort_omv``).

   Another possible use case for ``read_omv`` is the creation of R markdown
   files using the results of your jamovi analyses. The ``getSyn``-parameter
   determines whether the syntax of the analyses contained in the file is
   extracted. For running the syntax, the |jmv|_ R package needs to be
   installed. If you would like to work with the results afterwards, it is
   recommended that you assign them to a variable (see the second ``eval``
   below). Tables from the results can be converted into a data frame with
   the function ``asDF`` (e.g., ``result$main$asDF``).

   .. code-block:: R
   
      library(jmvReadWrite)
      library(jmv)
   
      data <- read_omv("FILENAME.omv", getSyn = TRUE)

      # the analyses are stored in the attribute syntax
      attr(data, "syntax")
      
      # with using an index, the n-th analysis can be accessed (first line)
      # and run / evaluated (second line)
      attr(data, "syntax")[[1]]
      eval(parse(text = attr(data, "syntax")[[1]]))

      # often it is more useful to assign the results to a variable when
      # running analyses and later on use the contents of that variable
      eval(parse(text = paste0("result = ", attr(data, "syntax")[[2]])))
      names(result)
      # (returns the names of the output elements - tables, figures, and
      # groups: sub-headings, e.g., Estimated Marginal Means in an ANOVA,
      # that contain further tables and figures)
