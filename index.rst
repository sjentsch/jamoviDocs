Welcome to the documentation for `jamovi <https://www.jamovi.org>`__, a free
and open statistical software to bridge the gap between researcher and
statistician.

Before we begin, a brief remark on how to use this web page. The content is
available in different languages. To change the language, please head to the
“jamovi documentation” roll-up menu (in the bottom-left corner) and click on
it. A larger menu unfolds where you can select the language you would like to
read the documentation in. So far, only a few languages are translated
completely, but you are very welcome to contribute to a `translation into your
language <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/jamovidocs/>`__.

===============
Getting started

   The following topics should get you up and running with jamovi, with
   additional topics available from the menu to the left.

   * :doc:`usermanual/um_1_installation`
   * :doc:`usermanual/um_2_first-steps`
   * :doc:`usermanual/um_3_analyses`
   * :doc:`usermanual/um_4_spreadsheet`
   * :doc:`usermanual/um_5_updating_data`
   * :doc:`usermanual/um_6_jamovi_and_R`

   You can find further topics in the menu on the right-hand side:
   step-for-step instructions for conducting common analyses (“Analyses”),
   brief instructions how to deal with common tasks (“How to…”), information
   regarding how to get started with developing modules to extend the function
   of jamovi (“Developers Hub”), and information aiming to ease the transition
   from SPSS (“From SPSS to jamovi”).
