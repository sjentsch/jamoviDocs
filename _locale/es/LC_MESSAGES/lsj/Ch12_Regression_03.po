"Stripped to its bare essentials, linear regression models are basically a"
" slightly fancier version of the Pearson correlation (Section "
"`Correlations <Ch12_Regression_01.html#correlations>`__), though as we’ll"
" see regression models are much more powerful tools."

"Since the basic ideas in regression are closely tied to correlation, "
"we’ll return to the ``parenthood`` dataset that we were using to "
"illustrate how correlations work. Recall that, in this data set we were "
"trying to find out why Dan is so very grumpy all the time and our working"
" hypothesis was that I’m not getting enough sleep. We drew some "
"scatterplots to help us examine the relationship between the amount of "
"sleep I get and my grumpiness the following day, as in :numref:`fig-"
"scatterplot2`, and as we saw previously this corresponds to a correlation"
" of *r* = -0.90, but what we find ourselves secretly imagining is "
"something that looks closer to :numref:`fig-regression1` (left panel). "
"That is, we mentally draw a straight line through the middle of the data."
" In statistics, this line that we’re drawing is called a **regression "
"line**. Notice that, since we’re not idiots, the regression line goes "
"through the middle of the data. We don’t find ourselves imagining "
"anything like the rather silly plot shown in :numref:`fig-regression1` "
"(right panel)."

"The left panel shows the sleep-grumpiness scatterplot from :numref:`fig-"
"scatterplot2` with the best fitting regression line drawn over the top. "
"Not surprisingly, the line goes through the middle of the data. In "
"contrast, panel b shows the same data, but with a very poor choice of "
"regression line drawn over the top."

"This is not highly surprising. The line that I’ve drawn in :numref:`fig-"
"regression1` (right panel) doesn’t “fit” the data very well, so it "
"doesn’t make a lot of sense to propose it as a way of summarising the "
"data, right? This is a very simple observation to make, but it turns out "
"to be very powerful when we start trying to wrap just a little bit of "
"maths around it. To do so, let’s start with a refresher of some high "
"school maths. The formula for a straight line is usually written like "
"this:"

"Or, at least, that’s what it was when I went to high school all those "
"years ago. The two *variables* are *x* and *y*, and we have two "
"*coefficients*, *a* and *b*\\.\\ [#]_ The coefficient *a* represents the "
"**y-intercept** of the line, and coefficient *b* represents the *slope* "
"of the line. Digging further back into our decaying memories of high "
"school (sorry, for some of us high school was a long time ago), we "
"remember that the intercept is interpreted as “the value of *y* that you "
"get when *x* = 0”. Similarly, a slope of *b* means that if you increase "
"the *x*-value by 1 unit, then the *y*-value goes up by *b* units, and a "
"negative slope means that the *y*-value would go down rather than up. Ah "
"yes, it’s all coming back to me now. Now that we’ve remembered that it "
"should come as no surprise to discover that we use the exact same formula"
" for a regression line. If *Y* is the outcome variable (the DV) and *X* "
"is the predictor variable (the IV), then the formula that describes our "
"regression is written like this:"

"Hmm. Looks like the same formula, but there’s some extra frilly bits in "
"this version. Let’s make sure we understand them. Firstly, notice that "
"I’ve written *X*\\ :sub:`i` and *Y*\\ :sub:`i` rather than just plain old"
" *X* and *Y*. This is because we want to remember that we’re dealing with"
" actual data. In this equation, *X*\\ :sub:`i` is the value of predictor "
"variable for the i\\ th observation (i.e., the number of hours of sleep "
"that I got on day i of my little study), and *Y*\\ :sub:`i` is the "
"corresponding value of the outcome variable (i.e., my grumpiness on that "
"day). And although I haven’t said so explicitly in the equation, what "
"we’re assuming is that this formula works for all observations in the "
"data set (i.e., for all i). Secondly, notice that I wrote *Ŷ*\\ :sub:`i` "
"and not *Y*\\ :sub:`i`. This is because we want to make the distinction "
"between the *actual data* *Y*\\ :sub:`i`, and the *estimate* *Ŷ*\\ "
":sub:`i` (i.e., the prediction that our regression line is making). "
"Thirdly, I changed the letters used to describe the coefficients from *a*"
" and *b* to *b*\\ :sub:`0` and *b*\\ :sub:`1`. That’s just the way that "
"statisticians like to refer to the coefficients in a regression model. "
"I’ve no idea why they chose *b*, but that’s what they did. In any case "
"*b*\\ :sub:`0` always refers to the intercept term, and *b*\\ :sub:`1` "
"refers to the slope."

"Excellent, excellent. Next, I can’t help but notice that, regardless of "
"whether we’re talking about the good regression line or the bad one, the "
"data don’t fall perfectly on the line. Or, to say it another way, the "
"data *Y*\\ :sub:`i` are not identical to the predictions of the "
"regression model *Ŷ*\\ :sub:`i`. Since statisticians love to attach "
"letters, names and numbers to everything, let’s refer to the difference "
"between the model prediction and that actual data point as a *residual*, "
"and we’ll refer to it as ε\\ :sub:`i`.\\ [#]_ Written using mathematics, "
"the residuals are defined as"
