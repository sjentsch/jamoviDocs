"The aim of the jamovi guide is to provide short, non-technical tutorials on "
"how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi. However, it is not a"
" resource providing an in-depth introduction into the background of those "
"procedures. For such an endevaour, there are plenty of other resources, e.g "
"the free e-book `learning statistics with jamovi "

"The t-test is used to test whether the mean value in a normally distributed "
"data set deviates significantly from a null hypothesis (which assumes that "
"there is no difference). The concept is presented in this `introductory "

"The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that examines how "
"the impact of one or more factors affects an outcome (dependent) variable. "
"These factors are the predictor variables and are categorical. Typically, "
"such factors reflect an experimental manipulation (e.g. with or without "
"treatment), but a factor can also represent groups for whose influence one "
"would like to control (e.g. gender: men or women). The analysis of variance "
"is based on a concept similar to that of the t-test, but it goes beyond "
"that, in that factors can have several levels (t-tests only allow two) and "
"in that several factors can be examined simultaneously. An introduction into"
" the concept of an ANOVA is presented in this `video "

"There are different types of analysis of variance, which differ in the "
"number of factors examined - one or more factors - or whether they compare "

"Correlation and regression analyses are statistical methods for assessing "
"the relationships between a dependent / outcome variable and one or more "
"independent / predictor variables. While the *correlation* analysis examines"
" the *relationship* between one predictor and one outcome variable, "
"*regression* analysis mainly focuses on *prediction* (how well can one or "
"more variables predict another (outcome) variable). Often, a distinction is "
"made between linear and non-linear (e.g., logistic regression). An "
"introduction into the concept of regression analyses is presented in this "
"`video "
