"I’m pretty sure I know what you’re thinking after reading the last section, "
"*especially* if you followed my advice and did all of that by pencil and "
"paper (i.e., in a spreadsheet) yourself. Doing the ANOVA calculations "
"yourself *sucks*. There’s quite a lot of calculations that we needed to do "
"along the way, and it would be tedious to have to do this over and over again "
"every time you wanted to do an ANOVA."

"To make life easier for you, jamovi can do ANOVA..hurrah! Go to the ``ANOVA`` "
"- ``ANOVA`` analysis, and move the ``mood.gain`` variable across so it is in "
"the ``Dependent Variable`` box, and then move the ``drug`` variable across so "
"it is in the ``Fixed Factors`` box. This should give the results as shown in "
":numref:`fig-anova2`.\\ [#]_ Note I have also checked the η² checkbox, "
"pronounced “eta” squared, under the ``Effect Size`` option and this is also "
"shown on the results table. We will come back to effect sizes a bit later."

"The jamovi results table shows you the sums of squares values, the degrees of "
"freedom, and a couple of other quantities that we’re not really interested in "
"right now. Notice, however, that jamovi doesn’t use the names “between-group” "
"and “within-group”. Instead, it tries to assign more meaningful names. In our "
"particular example, the *between groups* variance corresponds to the effect "
"that the ``drug`` has on the outcome variable, and the *within groups* "
"variance corresponds to the “leftover” variability so it calls that the "
"*residuals*. If we compare these numbers to the numbers that I calculated by "
"hand in Section `A worked example <Ch13_ANOVA_02.html#a-worked-example>`__, "
"you can see that they’re more or less the same, apart from rounding errors. "
"The between groups sums of squares is SS\\ :sub:`b` = 3.45, the within groups "
"sums of squares is SS\\ :sub:`w` = 1.39, and the degrees of freedom are 2 and "
"15 respectively. We also get the *F*-value and the *p*-value and, again, "
"these are more or less the same, give or take rounding errors, to the numbers "
"that we calculated ourselves when doing it the long and tedious way."
