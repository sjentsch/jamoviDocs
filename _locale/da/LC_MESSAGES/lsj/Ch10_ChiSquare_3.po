"Okay, time for a little bit of a digression. I’ve been lying to you a little "
"bit so far. There’s a tiny change that you need to make to your calculations "
"whenever you only have 1 degree of freedom. It’s called the “continuity "
"correction”, or sometimes the **Yates correction**. Remember what I pointed "
"out earlier: the χ² test is based on an approximation, specifically on the "
"assumption that the binomial distribution starts to look like a normal "
"distribution for large *N*. One problem with this is that it often doesn’t "
"quite work, especially when you’ve only got 1 degree of freedom (e.g., when "
"you’re doing a test of independence on a 2 · 2 contingency table). The main "
"reason for this is that the true sampling distribution for the *X*\\²-"
"statistic is actually discrete (because you’re dealing with categorical "
"data!) but the χ² distribution is continuous. This can introduce systematic "
"problems. Specifically, when *N* is small and when *df* = 1, the goodness-of-"
"fit statistic tends to be “too big”, meaning that you actually have a bigger "
"*α* value than you think (or, equivalently, the *p* values are a bit too "
"small)."

"As far as I can tell from reading Yates’ paper, the correction is basically a "
"hack. It’s not derived from any principled theory. Rather, it’s based on an "
"examination of the behaviour of the test, and observing that the corrected "
"version seems to work better. You can specify this correction in jamovi from "
"a check box in the ‘Statistics’ options, where it is called ‘χ² continuity "
"correction’."
