"So, our attempt to identify underlying latent factors using EFA with "
"carefully selected questions from the personality item pool seemed to be "
"pretty successful. The next step in our quest to develop a useful measure of "
"personality is to check the latent factors we identified in the original EFA "
"with a different sample. We want to see if the factors hold up, if we can "
"confirm their existence with different data. This is a more rigorous check, "
"as we will see. And it’s called **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)** as we "
"will, unsuprisingly, be seeking to *confirm* a pre-specificied latent factor "
"structure.\\ [#]_"

"In CFA, instead of doing an analysis where we see how the data goes together "
"in an exploratory sense, we instead impose a structure, like in :numref:`fig-"
"cfa1`, on the data and see how well the data fits our pre-specified "
"structure. In this sense, we are undertaking a confirmatory analysis, to see "
"how well a pre-specified **model** is confirmed by the observed data."

"A straightforward confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the personality items "
"would therefore specify five latent factors as shown in :numref:`fig-cfa1`, "
"each measured by five observed variables. Each variable is a measure of an "
"underlying latent factor. For example, ``A1`` is predicted by the underlying "
"latent factor Agreeableness. And because ``A1`` is not a perfect measure of "
"the Agreeableness factor, there is an error term, *e*, associated with it. In "
"other words, *e* represents the variance in ``A1`` that is not accounted for "
"by the Agreeableness factor. This is sometimes called **measurement error**."

"The next step is to consider whether the latent factors should be allowed to "
"correlate in our model. As mentioned earlier, in the psychological and "
"behavioural sciences constructs are often related to each other, and we also "
"think that some of our personality factors may be correlated with each other. "
"So, in our model, we should allow these latent factors to co-vary, as shown "
"by the double-headed arrows in :numref:`fig-cfa1`."

"At the same time, we should consider whether there is any good, systematic, "
"reason for some of the error terms to be correlated with each other. One "
"reason for this might be that there is a shared methodological feature for "
"particular sub-sets of the observed variables such that the observed "
"variables might be correlated for methodological rather than substantive "
"latent factor reasons. We’ll return to this possibility in a later section "
"but, for now, there are no clear reasons that we can see that would justify "
"correlating some of the error terms with each other."

"Without any correlated error terms, the model we are testing to see how well "
"it fits with our observed data is just as specified in :numref:`fig-cfa1`. "
"Only parameters that are included in the model are expected to be found in "
"the data, so in CFA all other possible parameters (coefficients) are set to "
"zero. So, if these other parameters are not zero (for example there may be a "
"substantial loading from ``A1`` onto the latent factor Extraversion in the "
"observed data, but not in our model) then we may find a poor fit between our "
"model and the observed data."

"There are several ways of assessing model fit. The first is a χ²-statistic "
"that, if small, indicates that the model is a good fit to the data. However, "
"the χ²-statistic used for assessing model fit is pretty sensitive to sample "
"size, meaning that with a large sample a good enough fit between the model "
"and the data almost always produces a large and significant (p < 0.05) χ²-"
"value."

"So, we need some other ways of assessing model fit. jamovi provides several "
"by default. These are the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis Index "
"(TLI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) together with "
"the 90% confidence interval for the RMSEA. Some useful rules of thumb are "
"that a satisfactory fit is indicated by CFI > 0.9, TLI > 0.9, and RMSEA of "
"about 0.05 to 0.08. A good fit is CFI > 0.95, TLI > 0.95, and RMSEA and upper "
"CI for RMSEA < 0.05."

"So, looking at :numref:`fig-cfa3`, we can see that the χ²-value is large and "

"indicates a poor fit. The CFI is 0.762 and the TLI is 0.731, indicating poor "
"fit between the model and the data. The RMSEA is 0.085 with a 90% confidence "
"interval from 0.077 to 0.092, again this does not indicate a good fit."

"Pretty disappointing, huh? But perhaps not too surprising given that in the "
"earlier EFA, when we ran with a similar data set (Section `Exploratory Factor "

"What we are looking for is the highest modification index (MI) value. We "

"Neuroticism and Extraversion). I can’t think of a good reason. But, for the "
"sake of argument, let’s pretend it does make some sense and add this path "
"into the model. Go back to the CFA analysis window (see :numref:`fig-cfa2`) "

"change (not shown); the χ²-value has come down to around 709 (a drop of "
