"Previous chapters have covered statistical tests for differences between two "
"or more groups. However, sometimes when conducting research, we may wish to "
"examine how multiple variables *co-vary*. That is, how they are related to "
"each other and whether the patterns of relatedness suggest anything "
"interesting and meaningful. For example, we are often interested in exploring "
"whether there are any underlying unobserved **latent factors** that are "
"represented by the observed, directly measured, variables in our dataset. In "
"statistics, latent factors are initially hidden variables that are not "
"directly observed but are rather inferred (through statistical analysis) from "
"other variables that are observed (directly measured)."

"In this chapter we will consider a number of different Factor Analysis and "
"related techniques, starting with `Exploratory Factor Analysis "
"<Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1.html#exploratory-factor-analysis>`__ (EFA). EFA is a "
"statistical technique for identifying underlying latent factors in a data "
"set. In the next Section, we will cover `Principal Component Analysis "
"<Ch15_FactorAnalysis_2.html#principal-component-analysis>`__ (PCA) which is a "
"data reduction technique which, strictly speaking, does not identify "
"underlying latent factors. Instead, PCA simply produces a linear combination "
"of observed variables. Following this, the Section `Confirmatory Factor "
"Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_3.html#confirmatory-factor-analysis>`__ (CFA) "
"shows that, unlike EFA, with CFA you start with an idea - a model - of how "
"the variables in your data are related to each other. You then test your "
"model against the observed data and assess how good a fit the model is. A "
"more sophisticated version of CFA is the so-called `Multi-Trait Multi-Method "
"(MTMM) <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_4.html#multi-trait-multi-method-cfa>`__ approach "
"in which both latent factor and method variance are included in the model. "
"This is useful when there are different methodological approaches used for "
"measurement and therefore method variance is an important consideration. "
"Finally, we will cover a related analysis: `Internal consistency reliability "
"analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_5.html#internal-consistency-reliability-"
"analysis>`__ tests how consistently a scale measures a psychological "
"construct."
