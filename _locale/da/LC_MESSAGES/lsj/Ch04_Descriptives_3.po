"There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see "
"reported in the psychological literature: skew and kurtosis. In practice, "
"neither one is used anywhere near as frequently as the measures of central "
"tendency and variability that we’ve been talking about. Skew is pretty "
"important, so you do see it mentioned a fair bit, but I’ve actually never "
"seen kurtosis reported in a scientific article to date."

"Illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data set "
"(skewness = -.93), in the middle we have a data set with no skew (well, "
"hardly any: skewness = -.006), and on the right we have a positively skewed "
"data set (skewness = 0.93)."

"Since it’s the more interesting of the two, let’s start by talking about the "
"**skewness**. Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry and the easiest "
"way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As :numref:`fig-skewness` "
"illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., "
"the lower tail is “longer” than the upper tail) and not so many extremely "
"large values (left panel) then we say that the data are *negatively skewed*. "
"On the other hand, if there are more extremely large values than extremely "
"small ones (right panel) we say that the data are *positively skewed*. That’s "
"the qualitative idea behind skewness. If there are relatively more values "
"that are far greater than the mean, the distribution is positively skewed or "
"right skewed, with a tail stretching to the right. Negative or left skew is "
"the opposite. A symmetric distribution has a skewness of 0. The skewness "
"value for a positively skewed distribution is positive, and a negative value "
"for a negatively skewed distribution."

"Perhaps more helpfully, you can use jamovi to calculate skewness: it’s a "
"check box in the ``Statistics`` options under ``Exploration`` → "
"``Descriptives``. For the ``afl.margins`` variable, the skewness figure is "
"**0.780**. If you divide the skewness estimate by the Std. error for skewness "
"you have an indication of how skewed the data is. Especially in small samples "
"(*N* < 50), one rule of thumb suggests that a value of 2 or less can mean "
"that the data is not very skewed, and a value of over 2 that there is "
"sufficient skew in the data to possibly limit its use in some statistical "
"analyses. Though there is no clear agreement on this interpretation. That "
"said, this does indicate that the AFL winning margins data is somewhat skewed "
"(0.780 / 0.183 = 4.262)."

"Illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a “platykurtic” data set "

"The final measure that is sometimes referred to, though very rarely in "
"practice, is the **kurtosis** of a data set. Put simply, kurtosis is a "
"measure of the “pointiness” of a data set, as illustrated in :numref:`fig-"
"kurtosis`. By convention, we say that the “normal curve” (black lines) has "
"zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed relative to this "
