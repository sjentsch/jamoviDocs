"In this chapter I’ll discuss how to get started in jamovi. I’ll briefly talk "
"about how to download and install jamovi, but most of the chapter will be "
"focused on getting you started with finding your way around the jamovi GUI. "
"Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical concepts: we’re just "
"trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and get comfortable "
"interacting with the system. To do this we’ll spend a bit of time looking at "
"datasets and variables. In doing so, you’ll get a bit of a feel for what it’s "
"like to work in jamovi."

"However, before going into any of the specifics, it’s worth talking a little "
"about why you might want to use jamovi at all. Given that you’re reading this "
"you’ve probably got your own reasons. However, if those reasons are “because "
"that’s what my stats class uses”, it might be worth explaining a little why "
"your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the class. Of course, I don’t "
"really know why *other* people choose jamovi so I’m really talking about why "
"I use it."

"It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics on a "
"computer is faster, easier and more powerful than doing statistics by hand. "
"Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of statistical "
"calculations are both mindless and repetitive. For most people the only "
"reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil and paper is for "
"learning purposes. In my class I do occasionally suggest doing some "
"calculations that way, but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does "
"help you to get a “feel” for statistics to do some calculations yourself, so "
"it’s worth doing it once. But only once!"

"Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is "
"generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people likely feel more "
"familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited in terms of what analyses "
"they allow you do. If you get into the habit of trying to do your real life "
"data analysis using spreadsheets then you’ve dug yourself into a very deep "
"hole."

"Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of "
"commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and some "
"of which I don’t. They’re usually very glossy in their appearance and "
"generally very powerful (much more powerful than spreadsheets). However, "
"they’re also very expensive. Usually, the company sells “student versions” "
"(crippled versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and then they they sell "
"full powered “educational versions” at a price that makes me wince. They will "
"also sell commercial licences with a staggeringly high price tag. The "
"business model here is to suck you in during your student days and then leave "
"you dependent on their tools when you go out into the real world. It’s hard "
"to blame them for trying, but personally I’m not in favour of shelling out "
"thousands of dollars if I can avoid it. And you can avoid it. If you make use "
"of packages like jamovi that are open source and free you never get trapped "
"having to pay exorbitant licensing fees."

"Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if you do "
"anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi is basically a "
"sophisticated front end for the free R statistical programming language. When "
"you download and install R you get all the basic “packages” and those are "
"very powerful on their own. However, because R is so open and so widely used, "
"it’s become something of a standard tool in statistics and so lots of people "
"write their own packages that extend the system. And these are freely "
"available too. One of the consequences of this, I’ve noticed, is that if you "
"look at recent advanced data analysis textbooks then a *lot* of them use R."

"Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It’s not without its flaws, though. "
"It’s relatively new\\ [#]_ so there is not a huge set of textbooks and other "
"resources to support it, and it has a few annoying quirks that we’re all "
"pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think the strengths outweigh the "
"weakness; more so than any other option I’ve encountered so far."
