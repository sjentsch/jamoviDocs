"``Nominal`` and ``Ordinal`` are, predictably, for nominal and ordinal "
"variables. ``Continuous`` is for variables with numeric values which are "
"considered to be *Interval* or *Ratio* scales (Equivalent to ``Scale`` in"
" SPSS). The ``ID`` measure type is, unlike the others, unique to jamovi. "
"It’s intended for variables that contain identifiers that you would "
"almost never want to analyse. For example, a persons name, or a "
"participant ID. The advantage of IDs, is that jamovi does not need to "
"maintain a list of levels internally, which can improve performance when "
"interacting with very large data sets."

"When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in, the data and"
" measure types will change automatically depending on the data you enter."
" This is a good way to get a feel for which variable types go with which "
"sorts of data. Similarly, when opening a data file, jamovi will infer the"
" variable type from the data in each column. In both cases, this "
"automatic approach may not be correct, and it may be necessary to "
"manually specify the data and measure type with the variable editor."

"The variable editor can be invoked by selecting ``Setup`` from the "
"``Data`` tab, double-clicking on the column header, or by pressing "
"``F3``. The variable editor allows you to change the name of the "
"variable, and (for data variables) the data type, the measure type, the "
"order of the levels, and the label displayed for each level. The variable"
" editor can be dismissed by clicking the close arrow, or by pressing "
"``F3`` again."

"*Computed variable*\\ s can be added to the data set, with the ``Add`` "

"A number of functions appear in pairs, one prefixed with a ``V`` and the "
"other not. ``V`` functions perform their calculation on a variable *as a "
"whole*, where as non-``V`` functions perform their calculation row by "
"row. For example, ``MEAN(A, B)`` will produce the mean of ``A`` and ``B``"
" for each row. Where as ``VMEAN(A)`` gives the mean of *all* the values "
"in ``A``."

"Additionally ``V`` functions support a ``group_by`` argument. When a "

"Filters in jamovi allow you to filter out rows that you don’t want "

"people’s survey responses if they explicitly consented to having their "
"data used, or you might want to exclude all left-handed people, or "
"perhaps people who score “below chance” in an experimental task. In some "
