"As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological "
"measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same "
"qualitative type and so it’s useful to understand what types there are. A"
" very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of "
"variables is what’s known as **scales of measurement**."

"A **nominal scale** variable (also referred to as a **categorical** "
"variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the"
" different possibilities. For these kinds of variables it doesn’t make "
"any sense to say that one of them is “bigger’ or “better” than any other "
"one, and it absolutely doesn’t make any sense to average them. The "
"classic example for this is “eye colour”. Eyes can be blue, green or "
"brown, amongst other possibilities, but none of them is any “bigger” than"
" any other one. As a result, it would feel really weird to talk about an "
"“average eye colour”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better"
" or worse than female. Neither does it make sense to try to talk about an"
" “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which "
"the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they"
" are different. That’s it."

"The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a **ratio scale** "

"response time (RT). In a lot of tasks it’s very common to record the "
"amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, "
"because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan"
" takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 "
"seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are"
" both meaningful here. Ben really did take 3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8 seconds longer"
" than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also "
"make sense here too: Ben took 3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35 times as long as Alan did "
"to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is that for a "
"ratio scale variable such as RT “zero seconds” really does mean “no time "

"Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal"
" scale variables are always discrete. There isn’t a type of "
"transportation that falls “in between” trains and bicycles, not in the "
"strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So "
"transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are "
"always discrete. Although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and "
"“3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st "
"place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go "
"either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is "
"continuous. Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) "
"is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval "
"scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. "
"The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio "
