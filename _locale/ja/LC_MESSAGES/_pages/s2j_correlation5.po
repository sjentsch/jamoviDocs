"This comparison shows how a semi-partial (or partial) correlation is "
"conducted in SPSS and jamovi. The SPSS test follows the description in "
"chapter 8.5.3 in `Field (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, "
"especially figure 8.11 and output 8.5. It uses the data set **Exam "
"Anxiety.sav** which can be downloaded from the `web page accompanying the"
" book <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e/student-resources/datasets>`__."
