"jamovi also provides an “R Syntax Mode”, in this mode, jamovi produces "
"equivalent R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select the"
" application menu (⋮) at the top right of jamovi, and check the ``Syntax "
"mode`` checkbox there. It is possible to leave syntax mode by clicking "
"this a second time."

"In syntax mode, analyses continue to operate as before, but now they "
"produce R syntax, and “ASCII output” like an R session. Like all results "
"objects in jamovi, you can right click on these items (including the R "
"syntax) and copy and paste them, for example, into an R session."

"At present, the provided R syntax does not include the data import step, "

"how to import data into R, and we recommend you take a look at these "
