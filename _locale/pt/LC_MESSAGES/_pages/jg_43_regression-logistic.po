"Logistic regression can be found by selecting ``Analyses`` → "
"``Regression``. If the outcome variable is nominal (as in the above "
"image), select ``2 Outcomes`` if it has 2 steps / different values, or "
"``N outcomes`` if it has *more* than 2 steps. If the outcome variable is "
"ordinal (e.g. low, medium, high), select ``Ordinal Outcomes``."
