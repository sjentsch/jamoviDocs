"Once a data set is set up with filters, computed variables, transforms "
"and analyses, sometimes you may want to update the data. This may be for "
"a number of reasons – It might be that you have a new data set, that you "
"want to apply the analyses you performed earlier to it, or you may be "
"conducting an experiment where you’re tesing a number of participants, "
"and you now have an additional participant’s data to analyse. By "
"importing into an existing data set you can re-run your analyses without "
"having to re-perform all of your data cleaning and analysis steps (making"
" your jamovi files behave a bit like scripts)."

"It is also possible to import multiple files at once. This can be useful "
"when you are combining multiple data sets, for example, where each file "
"represents a participant. The process is the same as the single-file "
"import detailed above, except that you select multiple files when "
"performing the import. You can do this by holding down control or shift "
"when selecting data files, or with the “multi-select” button at the top "
"of the import dialog."

"When importing multiple files like this, they are combined vertically "
"with the rows of the second file appearing below the first, the rows of "
"the third file appearing below the second, and so on. An additional "
"column called ``source`` is created detailing which file each row has "
"come from. This can be useful when you need to “split-by” or “group-by” "
"each participant. This column can be particularly useful to use with the "
"``group_by`` argument to ``V``-functions described above."

"Templates in jamovi are special data sets that are analagous to script "
"files in more traditional statistical environments. They are a way to "
"specify data types, computations, filters, transforms, and analyses in "
"advance. Once the data becomes available, it can be imported into the "
"template, and the template will update accordingly. The nice thing about "
"jamovi templates is that they are entirely specified with the familiar "
"user interface, and do not require working with a “syntax” or code."

"To save a data set as a template, select ``Export`` from the file menu, "
"and select ``jamovi template (.omt)`` from the file type box. When "
"opening a template, you’ll see it contains columns but no rows, and that "
"all the analysis results are blank. To use the template, import a new "
"data set (or data sets) using the file import described above. The data "
"will update, followed by the filters, computed variables, and finally the"
" analysis results."
