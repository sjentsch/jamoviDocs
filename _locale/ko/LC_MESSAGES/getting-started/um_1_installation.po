"At some institutions (particularly universities), the “normal” approach to "
"installing software is blocked by IT security policies. In this case, you "
"can download our .zip version. To use this, simply download, unzip to a "
"location on the computer, and naviagate to the bin folder. Double-clicking "
"jamovi.exe will begin jamovi. It’s possible that additional security "
"restrictions prevent jamovi from working in this way, in which case it would"
" be worth raising the issue with your IT staff."
