"This comparison shows how a regression with one predictor and two dummy "
"variables is performed in SPSS and jamovi. The SPSS test follows the "
"description in chapter 13.3 of `Field (2017) "
"<https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially Output 13.1 - 13.2. It "
"uses the data set **Puppy Love Dummy.sav** which can be downloaded from "
"the `web page accompanying the book <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e"
"/student-resources/datasets>`__."

"In SPSS, the output table ``Model Summary`` starts with *R* and *R²*. The"
" *R²*-value for model 1 shows the goodness of fit when only the covariate"
" is included in the analysis, and the value for model 2 shows the results"
" when the dummy variables and the covariate are included. The ``ANOVA`` "
"table presents the sum of squares for the regression, which tells us how "
"many units of variance the model accounts for. The most interesting table"
" is the ``Coefficients`` table, where you can find the differences  in "
"*b-*values and *β*-values for the two models, as well as their "
"significance values."

"for model 1 and a table for model 2. Nonetheless, the numbers appear in "
"the same place in the tables. The ``Coefficients`` table is also divided "
"into two tables - one for each model – in jamovi. Here the *b*-values are"

"Despite this, almost all the values are found in the same columns, except"
