"This comparison shows how a linear model with several predictors is "
"conducted in SPSS and jamovi. The SPSS test follows the description in "
"chapter 9.10-9.11 in `Field (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__,"
" especially figure 9.15-9.19 and 9.22-9.23 as well as output 9.5-9.12. It"
" uses the data set **Album Sales.sav** which can be downloaded from the "
"`web page accompanying the book <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e"

"In the Model Summary, you can see the summary statistics for model 1, "
