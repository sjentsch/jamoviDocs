"There is also no need to specify the ``label`` property of this "
"``OptionControl`` as the ``title`` property of the option is adequate and "
"will be automatically used by the ``CheckBox``. This means that a "
"``CheckBox`` can be defined in two lines! If the ``title`` property of the "

"added to the ``CheckBox`` to override it."

"The below example shows an option with the name ``effectSize``. This option "

msgid ""
"To achieve this two properties will need to be added to the ``CheckBox`` "
"definition: ``optionName`` and ``optionPart``. Both these properties are "
"inherited from ```OptionControl`` <ui_optioncontrol.html>`__. As has been "
"described in ``OptionControl`` documentation, ``optionName`` is used to "
"determine what option the ``CheckBox`` should bind to. Under normal "
"circumstances, it is not necessary to use ``optionName`` as the property "
"``name`` can be used for the same effect. This however, becomes a problem "
"for defining a ``CheckBox`` that is linked to an ``NMXList`` as the ``name``"
" property also has a requirement to be unique across all controls. It is not"
" allowed to have two checkboxes (or any other control for that matter) with "
"the same name. Because of this, when binding to an ``MNXList`` we are "
"required to give the ``CheckBox`` a unique name and use the ``optionName`` "
"to bind to the desired ``NMXList``."

msgid ""
"Now binding solely to an ``NMXList`` is not a valid configuration for a "
"``CheckBox`` as it requires a boolean data type to operate correctly. To "
"overcome this, the ``CheckBox`` definition will need to not *just* bind to "
"the ``NMXList`` but also to one of the sub-options. This is achieved using "
"the ``optionPart`` property. By assigning the name of the desired sub-option"
" to this property, the ``CheckBox`` will operate base on that sub-options "
"existence in the underlying array."
