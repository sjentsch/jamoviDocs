"With these modifications, we've added a new table called `ttest` with the "

"The `type` for each column is specified as either `text`, `number` or "

"The `format` field is a string of comma separated values. It provides "
"additional information on how a column should be formatted. In the case of "
"the p column, it has two formats applied, `zto` and `pvalue`. `zto` "
"indicates that a value ranges between zero and one; this causes it to be "
"rendered to a fixed number of decimal places. In contrast, values without "
"this format are formatted to a fixed number of significant figures. This "
"makes the biggest difference with values close to zero; without `zto` the "
"value 0.006 would be rendered `0.00600` (3 significant figures), where as "
"with `zto` it would be rendered `0.006` (3 decimal places). With values like"
" correlation coefficients and other values which range between zero and one,"
" the latter is generally preferred."

"Now we’ve created a table, let’s fill it in with the values from the t-test."
" For this, we need to extract the actual values from the t-test object "
"returned by R’s ``t.test`` function. Rather awkwardly, analyses in R don’t "
"return consistent results objects; there’s generally no predictable way to "
"know how to access the underlying values. Some R functions return lists, "
"others return S3 objects, others S4. Some require reading the values with "
"indices (``[[x]]``), others require the use of slots (``@``). It generally "
"requires a bit of trial and error to figure out how to access the underlying"
" values of a results object. One useful function for this is the ``mode()`` "
"function. For example, we can call mode on a ``t.test`` results object like "
