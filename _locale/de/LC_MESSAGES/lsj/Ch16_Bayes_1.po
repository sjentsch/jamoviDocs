"From a Bayesian perspective statistical inference is all about *belief "
"revision*. I start out with a set of candidate hypotheses *h* about the "
"world. I don’t know which of these hypotheses is true, but do I have some "
"beliefs about which hypotheses are plausible and which are not. When I "
"observe the data, *d*, I have to revise those beliefs. If the data are "
"consistent with a hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is strengthened. "
"If the data are inconsistent with the hypothesis, my belief in that "
"hypothesis is weakened. That’s it! At the end of this section I’ll give a "
"precise description of how Bayesian reasoning works, but first I want to "
"work through a simple example in order to introduce the key ideas. Consider "
"the following reasoning problem."
