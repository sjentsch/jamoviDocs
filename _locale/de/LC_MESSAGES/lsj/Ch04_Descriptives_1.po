"Drawing pictures of the data, as I did in :numref:`fig-aflMargins`, is an "
"excellent way to convey the “gist” of what the data is trying to tell you. "
"It’s often extremely useful to try to condense the data into a few simple "
"“summary” statistics. In most situations, the first thing that you’ll want "
"to calculate is a measure of **central tendency**. That is, you’d like to "
"know something about where the “average” or “middle” of your data lies. The "
"three most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode. I’ll "

"If your data are nominal scale you probably shouldn’t be using either the "

"Let’s expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there are "
"systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is"
" asymmetric (skewed; see `Skew and kurtosis <Ch04_Descriptives_3.html#skew-"
"and-kurtosis>`__). This is illustrated in :numref:`fig-meanmedian`. Notice "
"that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the “body” of the "
"histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail”"
" (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob "
"(income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are "
"sitting at a table. The average income at the table is $58,333 and the "
"median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income "
"$100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the "
"median rises only to $62,500. If you’re interested in looking at the overall"
" income at the table the mean might be the right answer. But if you’re "
"interested in what counts as a typical income at the table the median would "
"be a better choice here."
