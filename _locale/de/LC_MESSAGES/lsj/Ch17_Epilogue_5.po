"Okay, that was a long list. And even that listing is massively incomplete. "
"There really are a *lot* of big ideas in statistics that I haven’t covered "
"in this book. It can seem pretty depressing to finish an almost 500-page "
"textbook only to be told that this is only the beginning, especially when "
"you start to suspect that half of the stuff you’ve been taught is wrong. For"
" instance, there are a lot of people in the field who would strongly argue "
"against the use of the classical ANOVA model, yet I’ve devoted two whole "
"chapters to it! Standard ANOVA can be attacked from a Bayesian perspective, "
"or from a robust statistics perspective, or even from a “it’s just plain "
"wrong” perspective (people very frequently use ANOVA when they should "
"actually be using mixed models). So why learn it at all?"

"As I see it, there are two key arguments. Firstly, there’s the pure "
"pragmatism argument. Rightly or wrongly, ANOVA is widely used. If you want "
"to understand the scientific literature, you need to understand ANOVA. And "
"secondly, there’s the “incremental knowledge” argument. In the same way that"
" it was handy to have seen one-way ANOVA before trying to learn factorial "
"ANOVA, understanding ANOVA is helpful for understanding more advanced tools,"
" because a lot of those tools extend on or modify the basic ANOVA setup in "
"some way. For instance, although mixed models are way more useful than ANOVA"
" and regression, I’ve never heard of anyone learning how mixed models work "
"without first having worked through ANOVA and regression. You have to learn "
"to crawl before you can climb a mountain."

"Actually, I want to push this point a bit further. One thing that I’ve done "
"a lot of in this book is talk about fundamentals. I spent a lot of time on "
"probability theory. I talked about the theory of estimation and hypothesis "
"tests in more detail than I needed to. Why did I do all this? Looking back, "
"you might ask whether I really *needed* to spend all that time talking about"
" what a probability distribution is, or why there was even a section on "
"probability density. If the goal of the book was to teach you how to run a "
"t-test or an ANOVA, was all that really necessary? Was this all just a huge "
"waste of everyone’s time???"

"The answer, I hope you’ll agree, is no. The goal of an introductory stats is"
" *not* to teach ANOVA. It’s not to teach t-tests, or regressions, or "
"histograms, or p-values. The goal is to start you on the path towards "
"becoming a skilled data analyst. And in order for you to become a skilled "
"data analyst, you need to be able to do more than ANOVA, more than t-tests, "
"regressions and histograms. You need to be able to *think properly* about "
"data. You need to be able to learn the more advanced statistical models that"
" I talked about in the last section, and to understand the theory upon which"
" they are based. And you need to have access to software that will let you "
"use those advanced tools. And this is where, in my opinion at least, all "
"that extra time I’ve spent on the fundamentals pays off. If you understand "
"probability theory, you’ll find it much easier to switch from frequentist "
"analyses to Bayesian ones."

"In short, I think that the big payoff for learning statistics this way is "
"*extensibility*. For a book that only covers the very basics of data "
"analysis, this book has a massive overhead in terms of learning probability "
"theory and so on. There’s a whole lot of other things that it pushes you to "
"learn besides the specific analyses that the book covers. So if your goal "
"had been to learn how to run an ANOVA in the minimum possible time, well, "
"this book wasn’t a good choice. But as I say, I don’t think that is your "
"goal. *I* think you want to learn how to do data analysis. And if that "
"really is your goal, you want to make sure that the skills you learn in your"
" introductory stats class are naturally and cleanly extensible to the more "
"complicated models that you need in real world data analysis. You want to "
"make sure that you learn to use the same tools that real data analysts use, "
"so that you can learn to do what they do. And so yeah, okay, you’re a "
"beginner right now (or you were when you started this book), but that "
"doesn’t mean you should be given a dumbed-down story, a story in which I "
"don’t tell you about probability density, or a story where I don’t tell you "
"about the nightmare that is factorial ANOVA with unbalanced designs. And it "
"doesn’t mean that you should be given baby toys instead of proper data "
"analysis tools. Beginners aren’t dumb, they just lack knowledge. What you "
"need is *not* to have the complexities of real world data analysis hidden "
"from from you. What you need are the skills and tools that will let you "
"handle those complexities when they inevitably ambush you in the real world."

"day turn into, is able to help you with that."
