"At the start of the last chapter I highlighted the critical distinction "
"between *descriptive statistics* and *inferential statistics*. As discussed "
"in `Descriptive statistics <Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-"
"statistics>`__, the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarise"
" what we *do* know. In contrast, the purpose of inferential statistics is to"
" “learn what we do not know from what we do”. Now that we have a foundation "
"in probability theory we are in a good position to think about the problem "
"of statistical inference. What kinds of things would we like to learn about?"
" And how do we learn them? These are the questions that lie at the heart of "
"inferential statistics, and they are traditionally divided into two “big "
"ideas”: estimation and hypothesis testing. The goal in this chapter is to "
"introduce the first of these big ideas, estimation theory, but I’m going to "
"witter on about sampling theory first because estimation theory doesn’t make"
" sense until you understand sampling. As a consequence, this chapter divides"
" naturally into two parts `Samples, populations and sampling "
"<Ch08_Estimation_1.html#samples-populations-and-sampling>`__ through "
"`Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem "
"<Ch08_Estimation_3.html#sampling-distributions-and-the-central-limit-"
"theorem>`__ are focused on sampling theory, and `Estimating means and "
"standard deviations <Ch08_Estimation_4.html#estimating-population-"
"parameters>`__ and `Estimating a confidence interval "
"<Ch08_Estimation_5.html#estimating-a-confidence-interval>`__ make use of "
"sampling theory to discuss how statisticians think about estimation."
