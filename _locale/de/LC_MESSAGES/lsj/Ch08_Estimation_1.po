"In the prelude to Part  I discussed the riddle of induction and highlighted "
"the fact that *all* learning requires you to make assumptions. Accepting "
"that this is true, our first task to come up with some fairly general "
"assumptions about data that make sense. This is where **sampling theory** "
"comes in. If probability theory is the foundations upon which all "
"statistical theory builds, sampling theory is the frame around which you can"
" build the rest of the house. Sampling theory plays a huge role in "
"specifying the assumptions upon which your statistical inferences rely. And "
"in order to talk about “making inferences” the way statisticians think about"
" it we need to be a bit more explicit about what it is that we’re drawing "
"inferences *from* (the sample) and what it is that we’re drawing inferences "
"*about* (the population)."

"In almost every situation of interest what we have available to us as "
"researchers is a **sample** of data. We might have run experiment with some "
"number of participants, a polling company might have phoned some number of "
"people to ask questions about voting intentions, and so on. In this way the "
"data set available to us is finite and incomplete. We can’t possibly get "
"every person in the world to do our experiment, for example a polling "
"company doesn’t have the time or the money to ring up every voter in the "
"country. In our earlier discussion of `Descriptive statistics "
"<Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-statistics>`__, this sample was the only"
" thing we were interested in. Our only goal was to find ways of describing, "
"summarising and graphing that sample. This is about to change."

"A sample is a concrete thing. You can open up a data file and there’s the "
"data from your sample. A **population**, on the other hand, is a more "
"abstract idea. It refers to the set of all possible people, or all possible "
"observations, that you want to draw conclusions about and is generally "
"*much* bigger than the sample. In an ideal world the researcher would begin "
"the study with a clear idea of what the population of interest is, since the"
" process of designing a study and testing hypotheses with the data does "
"depend on the population about which you want to make statements."

"Sometimes it’s easy to state the population of interest. For instance, in "
"the “polling company” example that opened the chapter the population "
"consisted of all voters enrolled at the time of the study, millions of "
"people. The sample was a set of 1000 people who all belong to that "
"population. In most studies the situation is much less straightforward. In a"
" typical psychological experiment determining the population of interest is "
"a bit more complicated. Suppose I run an experiment using 100 undergraduate "
"students as my participants. My goal, as a cognitive scientist, is to try to"

"To keep things simple, let’s imagine that we have a bag containing 10 chips."
" Each chip has a unique letter printed on it so we can distinguish between "
"the 10 chips. The chips come in two colours, black and white. This set of "
"chips is the population of interest and it is depicted graphically on the "
"left of :numref:`fig-srs1`. As you can see from looking at the picture there"
" are 4 black chips and 6 white chips, but of course in real life we wouldn’t"
" know that unless we looked in the bag. Now imagine you run the following "
"“experiment”: you shake up the bag, close your eyes, and pull out 4 chips "
"without putting any of them back into the bag. First out comes the *a* chip "
"(black), then the *c* chip (white), then *j* (white) and then finally *b* "
"(black). If you wanted you could then put all the chips back in the bag and "
"repeat the experiment, as depicted on the right hand side of :numref:`fig-"
"srs1`. Each time you get different results but the procedure is identical in"
" each case. The fact that the same procedure can lead to different results "
"each time we refer to as a *random* process.\\ [#]_ However, because we "
"shook the bag before pulling any chips out, it seems reasonable to think "
"that every chip has the same chance of being selected. A procedure in which "
"every member of the population has the same chance of being selected is "
"called a **simple random sample**. The fact that we did *not* put the chips "
"back in the bag after pulling them out means that you can’t observe the same"
" thing twice, and in such cases the observations are said to have been "
"sampled **without replacement**."

"To help make sure you understand the importance of the sampling procedure, "
"consider an alternative way in which the experiment could have been run. "
"Suppose that my 5-year old son had opened the bag and decided to pull out "
"four black chips without putting any of them back in the bag. This *biased* "
"sampling scheme is depicted in :numref:`fig-brs`. Now consider the "
"evidential value of seeing 4 black chips and 0 white chips. Clearly it "
"depends on the sampling scheme, does it not? If you know that the sampling "
"scheme is biased to select only black chips then a sample that consists of "
"only black chips doesn’t tell you very much about the population! For this "
"reason statisticians really like it when a data set can be considered a "
"simple random sample, because it makes the data analysis *much* easier."

"A third procedure is worth mentioning. This time around we close our eyes, "
"shake the bag, and pull out a chip. This time, however, we record the "
"observation and then put the chip back in the bag. Again we close our eyes, "
"shake the bag, and pull out a chip. We then repeat this procedure until we "
"have 4 chips. Data sets generated in this way are still simple random "
"samples, but because we put the chips back in the bag immediately after "
"drawing them it is referred to as a sample **with replacement**. The "

"In my experience, most psychology experiments tend to be sampling without "

"*Stratified sampling*. Suppose your population is (or can be) divided into "
"several different sub-populations, or *strata*. Perhaps you’re running a "
"study at several different sites, for example. Instead of trying to sample "
"randomly from the population as a whole, you instead try to collect a "
"separate random sample from each of the strata. Stratified sampling is "
"sometimes easier to do than simple random sampling, especially when the "
"population is already divided into the distinct strata. It can also be more "
"efficient than simple random sampling, especially when some of the sub-"
"populations are rare. For instance, when studying schizophrenia it would be "
"much better to divide the population into two\\ [#]_ strata (schizophrenic "
"and not-schizophrenic) and then sample an equal number of people from each "
"group. If you selected people randomly you would get so few schizophrenic "
"people in the sample that your study would be useless. This specific kind of"
" of stratified sampling is referred to as *oversampling* because it makes a "
"deliberate attempt to over-represent rare groups."

"*Snowball sampling* is a technique that is especially useful when sampling "
"from a “hidden” or hard to access population and is especially common in "
"social sciences. For instance, suppose the researchers want to conduct an "
"opinion poll among transgender people. The research team might only have "
"contact details for a few trans folks, so the survey starts by asking them "
"to participate (stage 1). At the end of the survey the participants are "
"asked to provide contact details for other people who might want to "
"participate. In stage 2 those new contacts are surveyed. The process "
"continues until the researchers have sufficient data. The big advantage to "
"snowball sampling is that it gets you data in situations that might "
"otherwise be impossible to get any. On the statistical side, the main "
"disadvantage is that the sample is highly non-random, and non-random in ways"
" that are difficult to address. On the real life side, the disadvantage is "
"that the procedure can be unethical if not handled well, because hidden "
"populations are often hidden for a reason. I chose transgender people as an "
"example here to highlight this issue. If you weren’t careful you might end "
"up outing people who don’t want to be outed (very, very bad form), and even "
"if you don’t make that mistake it can still be intrusive to use people’s "
"social networks to study them. It’s certainly very hard to get people’s "
"informed consent *before* contacting them, yet in many cases the simple act "
"of contacting them and saying “hey we want to study you” can be hurtful. "
"Social networks are complex things, and just because you can use them to get"
" data doesn’t always mean you should."

"*Convenience sampling* is more or less what it sounds like. The samples are "
"chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher, and not selected at "
"random from the population of interest. Snowball sampling is one type of "
"convenience sampling, but there are many others. A common example in "
"psychology are studies that rely on undergraduate psychology students. These"
" samples are generally non-random in two respects. First, reliance on "
"undergraduate psychology students automatically means that your data are "
"restricted to a single sub-population. Second, the students usually get to "
"pick which studies they participate in, so the sample is a self selected "
"subset of psychology students and not a randomly selected subset. In real "
"life most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. This is "
"sometimes a severe limitation, but not always."

"Okay, so real world data collection tends not to involve nice simple random "
"samples. Does that matter? A little thought should make it clear to you that"
" it *can* matter if your data are not a simple random sample. Just think "
"about the difference between :numref:`fig-srs1` and :numref:`fig-brs`. "
"However, it’s not quite as bad as it sounds. Some types of biased samples "
"are entirely unproblematic. For instance, when using a stratified sampling "
"technique you actually *know* what the bias is because you created it "
"deliberately, often to *increase* the effectiveness of your study, and there"
" are statistical techniques that you can use to adjust for the biases you’ve"

"More generally though, it’s important to remember that random sampling is a "
"means to an end, and not the end in itself. Let’s assume you’ve relied on a "
"convenience sample, and as such you can assume it’s biased. A bias in your "
"sampling method is only a problem if it causes you to draw the wrong "
"conclusions. When viewed from that perspective, I’d argue that we don’t need"
" the sample to be randomly generated in *every* respect, we only need it to "
"be random with respect to the psychologically-relevant phenomenon of "
"interest. Suppose I’m doing a study looking at working memory capacity. In "
"study 1, I actually have the ability to sample randomly from all human "
"beings currently alive, with one exception: I can only sample people born on"
" a Monday. In study 2, I am able to sample randomly from the Australian "
"population. I want to generalise my results to the population of all living "
"humans. Which study is better? The answer, obviously, is study 1. Why? "
"Because we have no reason to think that being “born on a Monday” has any "
"interesting relationship to working memory capacity. In contrast, I can "
"think of several reasons why “being Australian” might matter. Australia is a"
" wealthy, industrialised country with a very well-developed education "
"system. People growing up in that system will have had life experiences much"
" more similar to the experiences of the people who designed the tests for "
"working memory capacity. This shared experience might easily translate into "
"similar beliefs about how to “take a test”, a shared assumption about how "
"psychological experimentation works, and so on. These things might actually "
"matter. For instance, “test taking” style might have taught the Australian "
"participants how to direct their attention exclusively on fairly abstract "
"test materials much more than people who haven’t grown up in a similar "
"environment. This could therefore lead to a misleading picture of what "
"working memory capacity is."

"There are two points hidden in this discussion. First, when designing your "
"own studies, it’s important to think about what population you care about "
"and try hard to sample in a way that is appropriate to that population. In "
"practice, you’re usually forced to put up with a “sample of convenience” "
"(e.g., psychology lecturers sample psychology students because that’s the "
"least expensive way to collect data, and our coffers aren’t exactly "
"overflowing with gold), but if so you should at least spend some time "
"thinking about what the dangers of this practice might be. Second, if you’re"
" going to criticise someone else’s study because they’ve used a sample of "
"convenience rather than laboriously sampling randomly from the entire human "
"population, at least have the courtesy to offer a specific theory as to "
"*how* this might have distorted the results."

"Okay. Setting aside the thorny methodological issues associated with "
"obtaining a random sample, let’s consider a slightly different issue. Up to "
"this point we have been talking about populations the way a scientist might."
" To a psychologist a population might be a group of people. To an ecologist "
"a population might be a group of bears. In most cases the populations that "
"scientists care about are concrete things that actually exist in the real "
"world. Statisticians, however, are a funny lot. On the one hand, they *are* "
"interested in real world data and real science in the same way that "
"scientists are. On the other hand, they also operate in the realm of pure "
"abstraction in the way that mathematicians do. As a consequence, statistical"
" theory tends to be a bit abstract in how a population is defined. In much "
"the same way that psychological researchers operationalise our abstract "
"theoretical ideas in terms of concrete measurements (Section `Introduction "
"to psychological measurement <Ch02_StudyDesign_1.html#introduction-to-"
"psychological-measurement>`__), statisticians operationalise the concept of "
"a “population” in terms of mathematical objects that they know how to work "
"with. You’ve already come across these objects in Chapter `Introduction to "
