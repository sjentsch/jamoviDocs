"Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements to "
"statistical theory. The vast majority of scientific papers report the "
"results of some hypothesis test or another. As a consequence it is almost "
"impossible to get by in science without having at least a cursory "
"understanding of what a *p*-value means, making this one of the most "
"important chapters in the book. As usual, I’ll end the chapter with a quick "
"recap of the key ideas that we’ve talked about:"

"Later in the book, in Chapter `Bayesian statistics <Ch16_Bayes.html"
"#bayesian-statistics>`__, I’ll revisit the theory of null hypothesis tests "
"from a Bayesian perspective and introduce a number of new tools that you can"
" use if you aren’t particularly fond of the orthodox approach. But for now, "
"though, we’re done with the abstract statistical theory, and we can start "
"discussing specific data analysis tools."
