"In the previous section, I discussed the ideas behind variable "
"transformations and showed that a lot of the transformations that you might "
"want to apply to your data are based on fairly simple mathematical functions"
" and operations. In this section I want to return to that discussion and "
"mention several other mathematical functions and arithmetic operations that "
"are actually quite useful for a lot of real world data analysis. :numref"
":`tab-mathfunc` gives a brief overview of the various mathematical functions"
" I want to talk about here, or later.\\ [#]_ Obviously this doesn’t even "
"come close to cataloguing the range of possibilities available, but it does "
"cover a range of functions that are used regularly in data analysis and that"
" are available in jamovi."

"As I’ve mentioned earlier, jamovi has an useful range of mathematical "
"functions built into it and there really wouldn’t be much point in trying to"
" describe or even list all of them. For the most part, I’ve focused only on "
"those functions that are strictly necessary for this book. However I do want"
" to make an exception for logarithms and exponentials. Although they aren’t "
"needed anywhere else in this book, they are *everywhere* in statistics more "
"broadly. And not only that, there are a *lot* of situations in which it is "
"convenient to analyse the logarithm of a variable (i.e., to take a “log-"
"transform” of the variable). I suspect that many (maybe most) readers of "
"this book will have encountered logarithms and exponentials before, but from"
" past experience I know that there’s a substantial proportion of students "
"who take a social science statistics class who haven’t touched logarithms "
"since high school, and would appreciate a bit of a refresher."

"In order to understand logarithms and exponentials, the easiest thing to do "
"is to actually calculate them and see how they relate to other simple "
"calculations. There are three jamovi functions in particular that I want to "
"talk about, namely ``LN()``, ``LOG10()`` and ``EXP()``. To start with, let’s"
" consider ``LOG10()``, which is known as the “logarithm in base 10”. The "
"trick to understanding a **logarithm** is to understand that it’s basically "
"the “opposite” of taking a power. Specifically, the logarithm in base 10 is "
"closely related to the powers of 10. So let’s start by noting that 10-cubed "
"is 1000. Mathematically, we would write this:"

"The trick to understanding a logarithm is to recognise that the statement "
"that “10 to the power of 3 is equal to 1000” is equivalent to the statement "
"that “the logarithm (in base 10) of 1000 is equal to 3”. Mathematically, we "
"write this as follows,"

"Okay, since the ``LOG10()`` function is related to the powers of 10, you "
"might expect that there are other logarithms (in bases other than 10) that "
"are related to other powers too. And of course that’s true: there’s not "
"really anything mathematically special about the number 10. You and I happen"
" to find it useful because decimal numbers are built around the number 10, "
"but the big bad world of mathematics scoffs at our decimal numbers. Sadly, "
"the universe doesn’t actually care how we write down numbers. Anyway, the "
"consequence of this cosmic indifference is that there’s nothing particularly"
" special about calculating logarithms in base 10. You could, for instance, "
"calculate your logarithms in base 2. Alternatively, a third type of "
"logarithm, and one we see a lot more of in statistics than either base 10 or"
" base 2, is called the **natural logarithm**, and corresponds to the "
"logarithm in base *e*. Since you might one day run into it, I’d better "
"explain what *e* is. The number *e*, known as **Euler’s number**, is one of "
"those annoying “irrational” numbers whose decimal expansion is infinitely "
"long, and is considered one of the most important numbers in mathematics. "
"The first few digits of *e* are:"

msgid ""
"There are quite a few situation in statistics that require us to calculate "
"powers of *e*, though none of them appear in this book. Raising *e* to the "
"power *x* is called the **exponential** of *x*, and so it’s very common to "
"see e\\ :sup:`x` written as *exp(x)*. And so it’s no surprise that jamovi "
"has a function that calculates exponentials, called ``EXP()``. Because the "
"number *e* crops up so often in statistics, the natural logarithm (i.e., "
"logarithm in base *e*) also tends to turn up. Mathematicians often write it "
"as log\\ :sub:`e`\\ (x) or *ln(x)*. In fact, jamovi works the same way: the "
"``LN()`` function corresponds to the natural logarithm."
