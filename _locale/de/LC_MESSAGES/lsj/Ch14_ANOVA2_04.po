"As with one-way ANOVA, the key assumptions of factorial ANOVA are "
"homogeneity of variance (all groups have the same standard deviation), "
"normality of the residuals, and independence of the observations. The first "
"two are things we can check for. The third is something that you need to "
"assess yourself by asking if there are any special relationships between "
"different observations, for example repeated measures where the independent "
"variable is time so there is a relationship between the observations at time"
" one and time two: observations at different time points are from the *same*"
" people. Additionally, if you aren’t using a saturated model (e.g., if "
"you’ve omitted the interaction terms) then you’re also assuming that the "
"omitted terms aren’t important. Of course, you can check this last one by "
"running an ANOVA with the omitted terms included and see if they’re "
"significant, so that’s pretty easy. What about homogeneity of variance and "
"normality of the residuals? As it turns out, these are pretty easy to check."
" It’s no different to the checks we did for a one-way ANOVA."

"As mentioned in Section `Checking the homogeneity of variance assumption "
"<Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#checking-the-homogeneity-of-variance-assumption>`__, "
"it’s a good idea to visually inspect a plot of the standard deviations "
"compared across different groups / categories, and also see if the Levene "
"test is consistent with the visual inspection. The theory behind the Levene "
"test was discussed in that section, so I won’t discuss it again. This test "
"expects that you have a saturated model (i.e., including all of the relevant"
" terms), because the test is primarily concerned with the within-group "
"variance, and it doesn’t really make a lot of sense to calculate this any "
"way other than with respect to the full model. The Levene test can be "
"specified under the ANOVA ``Assumption Checks`` → ``Homogeneity Tests`` "
"option in jamovi, with the result shown as in :numref:`fig-factorialanova5`."
" The fact that the Levene test is non-significant means that, providing it "
"is consistent with a visual inspection of the plot of standard deviations, "
"we can safely assume that the homogeneity of variance assumption is not "
"violated."

"As with one-way ANOVA we can test for the normality of residuals in a "
"straightforward fashion (see `Checking the normality assumption "
"<Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#checking-the-normality-assumption>`__). Primarily "
"though, it’s generally a good idea to examine the residuals graphically "
"using a QQ-plot. See :numref:`fig-factorialanova5`."
