"At this point we need to start talking specifics about how a hypothesis test"
" is constructed. To that end, let’s return to the ESP example. Let’s ignore "
"the actual data that we obtained, for the moment, and think about the "
"structure of the experiment. Regardless of what the actual numbers are, the "
"*form* of the data is that *X* out of *N* people correctly identified the "
"colour of the hidden card. Moreover, let’s suppose for the moment that the "
"null hypothesis really is true, that ESP doesn’t exist and the true "
"probability that anyone picks the correct colour is exactly *θ* = 0.5. What "
"would we *expect* the data to look like? Well, obviously we’d expect the "
"proportion of people who make the correct response to be pretty close to "
"50%. Or, to phrase this in more mathematical terms, we’d say that *X* / *N* "
"is approximately \\0.5. Of course, we wouldn’t expect this fraction to be "
"*exactly* \\0.5. If, for example, we tested *N* = 100 people and *X* = 53 of"
" them got the question right, we’d probably be forced to concede that the "
"data are quite consistent with the null hypothesis. On the other hand, if "
"*X* = 99 of our participants got the question right then we’d feel pretty "
"confident that the null hypothesis is wrong. Similarly, if only *X* = 3 "
"people got the answer right we’d be similarly confident that the null was "
"wrong. Let’s be a little more technical about this. We have a quantity *X* "
"that we can calculate by looking at our data. After looking at the value of "
"*X* we make a decision about whether to believe that the null hypothesis is "
"correct, or to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. The "
"name for this thing that we calculate to guide our choices is a **test "
"statistic**."

"Having chosen a test statistic, the next step is to state precisely which "
"values of the test statistic would cause is to reject the null hypothesis, "
"and which values would cause us to keep it. In order to do so we need to "
"determine what the **sampling distribution of the test statistic** would be "
"if the null hypothesis were actually true (we talked about sampling "
"distributions earlier in `Sampling distribution of the mean "
"<Ch08_Estimation_3.html#sampling-distribution-of-the-mean>`__). Why do we "
"need this? Because this distribution tells us exactly what values of *X* our"
" null hypothesis would lead us to expect. And, therefore, we can use this "
"distribution as a tool for assessing how closely the null hypothesis agrees "
"with our data."

"The sampling distribution for our test statistic X when the null hypothesis "
"is true. For our ESP scenario this is a binomial distribution. Not "
"surprisingly, since the null hypothesis says that the probability of a "
"correct response is θ = 0.5, the sampling distribution says that the most "
"likely value is 50 (out of 100) correct responses. Most of the probability "
"mass lies between 40 and 60."

"How do we actually determine the sampling distribution of the test "
"statistic? For a lot of hypothesis tests this step is actually quite "
"complicated, and later on in the book you’ll see me being slightly evasive "
"about it for some of the tests (some of them I don’t even understand "
"myself). However, sometimes it’s very easy. And, fortunately for us, our ESP"
" example provides us with one of the easiest cases. Our population parameter"
" *θ* is just the overall probability that people respond correctly when "
"asked the question, and our test statistic *X* is the *count* of the number "
"of people who did so out of a sample size of *N*. We’ve seen a distribution "
"like this before, in Section `Binomial distribution <Ch07_Probability_4.html"
"#the-binomial-distribution>`__, and that’s exactly what the binomial "
"distribution describes! So, to use the notation and terminology that I "
"introduced in that section, we would say that the null hypothesis predicts "
"that *X* is binomially distributed, which is written"

"Since the null hypothesis states that *θ* = 0.5 and our experiment has *N* ="
" 100 people, we have the sampling distribution we need. This sampling "
"distribution is plotted in :numref:`fig-samplingDist`. No surprises really, "
"the null hypothesis says that *X* = 50 is the most likely outcome, and it "
"says that we’re almost certain to see somewhere between 40 and 60 correct "
