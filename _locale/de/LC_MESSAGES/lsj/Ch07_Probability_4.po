"As you might imagine, probability distributions vary enormously and there’s "
"an enormous range of distributions out there. However, they aren’t all "
"equally important. In fact, the vast majority of the content in this book "
"relies on one of five distributions: the binomial distribution, the normal "
"distribution, the *t*-distribution, the *χ²*-distribution (chi-square) and "
"the *F*-distribution. Given this, what I’ll do over the next few sections is"
" provide a brief introduction to all five of these, paying special attention"
" to the binomial and the normal. I’ll start with the binomial distribution "
"since it’s the simplest of the five."

"The theory of probability originated in the attempt to describe how games of"
" chance work, so it seems fitting that our discussion of the **binomial "
"distribution** should involve a discussion of rolling dice and flipping "
"coins. Let’s imagine a simple “experiment”. In my hot little hand I’m "
"holding 20 identical six-sided dice. On one face of each die there’s a "
"picture of a skull, the other five faces are all blank. If I proceed to roll"
" all 20 dice, what’s the probability that I’ll get exactly 4 skulls? "
"Assuming that the dice are fair, we know that the chance of any one die "
"coming up skulls is 1 in 6. To say this another way, the skull probability "
"for a single die is approximately 0.167. This is enough information to "
"answer our question, so let’s have a look at how it’s done."

"Formulas for the binomial and normal distributions. We don’t really use "
"these formulas for anything in this book, but they’re pretty important for "
"more advanced work, so I thought it might be best to put them here in a "
"table, where they can’t get in the way of the text. In the equation for the "
"binomial, *X!* is the factorial function (i.e., multiply all whole numbers "
"from 1 to *X*), and for the normal distribution “exp” refers to the "
"exponential function, which we discussed in Chapter `Pragmatic matters "
"<Ch06_DataHandling.html#pragmatic-matters>`__. If these equations don’t make"
" a lot of sense to you, don’t worry too much about them."

"As usual, we’ll want to introduce some names and some notation. We’ll let "
"*N* denote the number of dice rolls in our experiment, which is often "
"referred to as the **size parameter** of our binomial distribution. We’ll "
"also use *θ* to refer to the the probability that a single die comes up "
"skulls, a quantity that is usually called the **success probability** of the"
" binomial.\\ [#]_ Finally, we’ll use *X* to refer to the results of our "
"experiment, namely the number of skulls I get when I roll the dice. Since "
"the actual value of *X* is due to chance we refer to it as a **random "
"variable**. In any case, now that we have all this terminology and notation "
"we can use it to state the problem a little more precisely. The quantity "
"that we want to calculate is the probability that *X* = 4 given that we know"
" that *θ* = 0.167 and *N* = 20. The general “form” of the thing I’m "
"interested in calculating could be written as"

"and we’re interested in the special case where *X* = 4, *θ* = 0.167 and *N* "
"= 20. There’s only one more piece of notation I want to refer to before "
"moving on to discuss the solution to the problem. If I want to say that *X* "
"is generated randomly from a binomial distribution with parameters *θ* and "
"*N*, the notation I would use is as follows:"

"Yeah, yeah. I know what you’re thinking: notation, notation, notation. "
"Really, who cares? Very few readers of this book are here for the notation, "
"so I should probably move on and talk about how to use the binomial "
"distribution. I’ve included the formula for the binomial distribution in "
":numref:`tab-distformulas`, since some readers may want to play with it "
"themselves, but since most people probably don’t care that much and because "
"we don’t need the formula in this book, I won’t talk about it in any detail."
" Instead, I just want to show you what the binomial distribution looks like."

"Binomial distribution with size parameter of N = 20 and an underlying "
"success probability of θ = 1/6. Each vertical bar depicts the probability of"
" one specific outcome (i.e., one possible value of X). Because this is a "
"probability distribution, each of the probabilities must be a number between"
" 0 and 1, and the heights of the bars must sum to 1 as well."

"To that end, :numref:`fig-binomSkulls20` plots the binomial probabilities "
"for all possible values of *X* for our dice rolling experiment, from *X* = 0"
" (no skulls) all the way up to *X* = 20 (all skulls). Note that this is "
"basically a bar chart, and is no different to the “trousers probability” "
"plot I drew in :numref:`fig-pantsDistribution`. On the horizontal axis we "
"have all the possible events, and on the vertical axis we can read off the "
"probability of each of those events. So, the probability of rolling 4 skulls"
" out of 20 is about 0.20 (the actual answer is 0.2022036, as we’ll see in a "
"moment). In other words, you’d expect that to happen about 20% of the times "
"you repeated this experiment."

"To give you a feel for how the binomial distribution changes when we alter "
"the values of *θ* and *N*, let’s suppose that instead of rolling dice I’m "
"actually flipping coins. This time around, my experiment involves flipping a"
" fair coin repeatedly and the outcome that I’m interested in is the number "
"of heads that I observe. In this scenario, the success probability is now "
"*θ* = 1/2. Suppose I were to flip the coin *N* = 20 times. In this example, "
"I’ve changed the success probability but kept the size of the experiment the"
" same. What does this do to our binomial distribution? Well, as :numref"
":`fig-binomHeads` (left panel) shows, the main effect of this is to shift "
"the whole distribution, as you’d expect. Okay, what if we flipped a coin *N*"
" = 100 times? Well, in that case we get what is shown in the right panel. "
"The distribution stays roughly in the middle but there’s a bit more "
"variability in the possible outcomes."

"Note that the term “success” is pretty arbitrary and doesn’t actually imply "
"that the outcome is something to be desired. If *θ* referred to the "
"probability that any one passenger gets injured in a bus crash I’d still "
"call it the success probability, but that doesn’t mean I want people to get "
"hurt in bus crashes!"
