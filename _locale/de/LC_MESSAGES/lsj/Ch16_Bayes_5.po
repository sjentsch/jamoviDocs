"The first half of this chapter was focused primarily on the theoretical "
"underpinnings of Bayesian statistics. I introduced the mathematics for how "
"Bayesian inference works (Section `Probabilistic reasoning by rational "
"agents <Ch16_Bayes_1.html#probabilistic-reasoning-by-rational-agents>`__), "
"and gave a very basic overview of how `Bayesian hypothesis testing "
"<Ch16_Bayes_2.html#bayesian-hypothesis-tests>`__ is typically done. Finally,"
" I devoted some space to talking about why I think Bayesian methods are "
"worth using (Section `Why be a Bayesian? <Ch16_Bayes_3.html#why-"
"be-a-bayesian>`__). Then I gave a practical example, a `Bayesian t-test "
"<Ch16_Bayes_4.html#bayesian-t-tests>`__."

"If you’re interested in learning more about the Bayesian approach, there are"
" many good books you could look into. `John Kruschke’s (2011) "
"<References.html#kruschke-2011>`__ book *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis* is a "
"pretty good place to start and is a nice mix of theory and practice. His "
"approach is a little different to the “Bayes factor” approach that I’ve "
"discussed here, so you won’t be covering the same ground. If you’re a "
"cognitive psychologist, you might want to check out `Michael Lee and Eric-"
"Jan Wagenmakers’ (2014) <References.html#lee-2014>`__ book *Bayesian "
"Cognitive Modeling*. I picked these two because I think they’re especially "
"useful for people in my discipline, but there’s a lot of good books out "
"there, so look around!"
