"The first thing to understand is data collection can be thought of as a kind"
" of **measurement**. That is, what we’re trying to do here is measure "
"something about human behaviour or the human mind. What do I mean by "
"“measurement”?"

"Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to "
"finding some way of assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of "
"well-defined descriptions, to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count "

"My **age** (in years) could have been *0, 1, 2, 3 …*, etc. The upper bound "

"As you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the "
"set of possible measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a "
"bit tricky. But I want to point out that even in the case of someone’s age "
"it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above I "
"assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you’re a "
"developmental psychologist, that’s way too crude, and so you often measure "
"age in *years and months* (if a child is 2 years and 11 months this is "
"usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns you might want "
"to measure age in *days since birth*, maybe even *hours since birth*. In "
"other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values "
"is important."

"Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept "
"of “age” isn’t actually all that precise. In general, when we say “age” we "
"implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the "
"right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control "
"their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also"
" start to worry that “birth” is not the only meaningful point in time to "
"care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born "
"1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” "
"if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In one sense, yes. By social "
"convention we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in "
"everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been "
"operating as an independent entity in the world. But from a scientific "
"perspective that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the"
" biology of human beings, it’s often useful to think of ourselves as "
"organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from "
"that perspective Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might "
"want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of "
"time since conception and the length of time since birth. When dealing with "
"adults it won’t make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it "
"might."

"Moving beyond these issues, there’s the question of methodology. What "

"You could just ask people “how old are you?” The method of self-report is "

"You could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) “how old is your child?” This "
"method is fast, and when dealing with kids it’s not all that hard since the "
"parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know "
"“age since conception”, since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when "
"conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g.,"
" an obstetrician)."

"All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of "

"Defining the set of allowable values that the measurement can take. Note "
"that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. "
"When measuring age the values are numerical, but we still need to think "
"carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and"
" months, days, or hours? For other types of measurements (e.g., gender) the "
"values aren’t numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what "
"values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what"
" options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only "
"“male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give "
"people specific options and instead let them answer in their own words? And "
"if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, "
"how will you interpret their answers?"

"Operationalisation is a tricky business, and there’s no “one, true way” to "
"do it. The way in which you choose to operationalise the informal concept of"
" “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use"
" the measurement for. Often you’ll find that the community of scientists who"
" work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go "
"about it. In other words, operationalisation needs to be thought through on "
"a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are "
"specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it "
"that are pretty general."

"Before moving on I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in"
" the process introduce one more term. Here are four different things that "
"are closely related to each other:"

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_1.rst:148
msgid ""
"**A theoretical construct**. This is the thing that you’re trying to take a "
"measurement of, like “age”, “gender” or an “opinion”. A theoretical "
"construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re actually a bit "
"vague."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_1.rst:153
msgid ""
"**A measure**. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to "
"make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or"
" a brain scan could all count as a measure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_1.rst:157
msgid ""
"**An operationalisation**. The term “operationalisation” refers to the "
"logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to "
"the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical "
"construct."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_1.rst:162
msgid ""
"**A variable**. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when "
"we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the "
"actual “data” that we end up with in our data sets."
msgstr ""

"Well... now this is awkward, isn’t it? This section is one of the oldest "
"parts of the book, and it’s outdated in a rather embarrassing way. I wrote "
"this in 2010, at which point all of those facts *were* true. Revisiting this"
" in 2018, well I’m not 33 any more, but that’s not surprising I suppose. I "
"can’t imagine my chromosomes have changed, so I’m going to guess my "
"karyotype was then and is now XY. The self-identified gender, on the other "
"hand...ah. I suppose the fact that the title page now refers to me as "
"Danielle rather than Daniel might possibly be a giveaway, but I don’t "
"typically identify as “male” on a gender questionnaire these days, and I "
"prefer *“she/her”* pronouns as a default (it’s a long story)! I did think a "
"little about how I was going to handle this in the book, actually. The book "
"has a somewhat distinct authorial voice to it, and I feel like it would be a"
" rather different work if I went back and wrote everything as Danielle and "
"updated all the pronouns in the work. Besides, it would be a lot of work, so"
" I’ve left my name as “Dan” throughout the book, and in any case “Dan” is a "
"perfectly good nickname for “Danielle”, don’t you think? In any case, it’s "
"not a big deal. I only wanted to mention it to make life a little easier for"
" readers who aren’t sure how to refer to me. I still don’t like anchovies "
"though :-)"
