"The other day I was watching an animated documentary examining the quaint "
"customs of the natives of the planet *Chapek 9*. Apparently, in order to "
"gain access to their capital city a visitor must prove that they’re a robot,"
" not a human. In order to determine whether or not a visitor is human, the "
"natives ask whether the visitor prefers puppies, flowers, or large, properly"
" formatted data files. “Pretty clever,” I thought to myself “but what if "
"humans and robots have the same preferences? That probably wouldn’t be a "
"very good test then, would it?” As it happens, I got my hands on the testing"
" data that the civil authorities of *Chapek 9* used to check this. It turns "
"out that what they did was very simple. They found a bunch of robots and a "
"bunch of humans and asked them what they preferred. I saved their data in a "
"file called ``chapek9.omv``, which we can now load into jamovi. As well as "
"the ``ID`` variable that identifies individual people, there are two nominal"
" text variables, ``species`` and ``choice``. In total there are 180 entries "
"in the data set, one for each person (counting both robots and humans as "
"“people”) who was asked to make a choice. Specifically, there are 93 humans "
"and 87 robots, and overwhelmingly the preferred choice is the data file. You"
" can check this yourself by asking jamovi for Frequency Tables, under the "
"‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ button. However, this summary does not "
"address the question we’re interested in. To do that, we need a more "
"detailed description of the data. What we want to do is look at the "
"``choices`` broken down *by* ``species``. That is, we need to cross-tabulate"
" the data (see `Tabulating and cross-tabulating data "
"<Ch06_DataHandling_1.html#tabulating-and-cross-tabulating-data>`__). In "
"jamovi we do this using the ``Frequencies`` → ``Contingency Tables`` → "
