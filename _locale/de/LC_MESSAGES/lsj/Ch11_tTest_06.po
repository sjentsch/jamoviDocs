"When introducing the theory of null hypothesis tests, I mentioned that there"
" are some situations when it’s appropriate to specify a *one-sided* test "
"(see Section `The difference between one-sided and two-sided tests "
"<Ch09_HypothesisTesting_04.html#the-difference-between-one-sided-and-two-"
"sided-tests>`__). So far all of the *t*-tests have been two-sided tests. For"
" instance, when we specified a one sample *t*-test for the grades in Dr "
"Zeppo’s class the null hypothesis was that the true mean was 67.5%. The "
"alternative hypothesis was that the true mean was greater than *or* less "
"than 67.5%. Suppose we were only interested in finding out if the true mean "
"is greater than 67.5%, and have no interest whatsoever in testing to find "
"out if the true mean is lower than 67.5%. If so, our null hypothesis would "
"be that the true mean is 67.5% or less, and the alternative hypothesis would"
" be that the true mean is greater than 67.5%. In jamovi, for the ‘One Sample"
" *t*-Test’ analysis, you can specify this by clicking on the ``> Test "
"Value`` option, under ``Hypothesis``. When you have done this, you will get "
"the results as shown in :numref:`fig-ttest_onesided1`."

"Notice that there are a few changes from the output that we saw last time. "
"Most important is the fact that the actual hypothesis has changed, to "
"reflect the different test. The second thing to note is that although the "
"*t*-statistic and degrees of freedom have not changed, the *p*-value has. "
"This is because the one-sided test has a different rejection region from the"
" two-sided test. If you’ve forgotten why this is and what it means, you may "
"find it helpful to read back over Chapter `Hypothesis testing "
"<Ch09_HypothesisTesting.html#hypothesis-testing>`__, and Section `The "
"difference between one-sided and two-sided tests "
"<Ch09_HypothesisTesting_04.html#the-difference-between-one-sided-and-two-"
"sided-tests>`__ in particular. The third thing to note is that the "
"confidence interval is different too: it now reports a “one-sided” "
"confidence interval rather than a two-sided one. In a two-sided confidence "
"interval we’re trying to find numbers *a* and *b* such that we’re confident "
"that, if we were to repeat the study many times, then 95% of the time the "
"mean would lie *between* *a* and *b*. In a one-sided confidence interval, "
"we’re trying to find a single number *a* such that we’re confident that 95% "
"of the time the true mean would be *greater than* *a* (or less than *a* if "
"you selected Measure 1 < Measure 2 in the ‘Hypothesis’ section)."

"So that’s how to do a one-sided one sample *t*-test. However, all versions "
"of the *t*-test can be one-sided. For an independent samples t test, you "
"could have a one-sided test if you’re only interested in testing to see if "
"group A has *higher* scores than group B, but have no interest in finding "
"out if group B has higher scores than group A. Let’s suppose that, for Dr "
"Harpo’s class, you wanted to see if Anastasia’s students had higher grades "
"than Bernadette’s. For this analysis, in the ‘Hypothesis’ options, specify "
"that ``Group 1 > Group2``. You should get the results shown in :numref:`fig-"
"ttest_onesided2`."
