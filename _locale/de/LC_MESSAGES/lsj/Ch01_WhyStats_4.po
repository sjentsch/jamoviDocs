"I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so"
" focused on statistics. But I’m guessing that you have a lot more questions "
"about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why "
"psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So here’s my "
"attempt to answer a few of them..."

"To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of which are "
"better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is a "
"statistical science. What I mean by that is that the “things” that we study "
"are *people*. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly perverse "
"people. The “things” of physics include objects like electrons, and while "
"there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons don’t "
"have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they don’t differ from "
"each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get bored in the middle "
"of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the experimenter and then "
"deliberately try to sabotage the data set (not that I’ve ever done that!). "
"At a fundamental level psychology is harder than physics.\\ [#]_"

"Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to "
"be better at stats than physicists. There’s actually a saying used sometimes"
" in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment needs statistics, you "
"should have done a better experiment\". They have the luxury of being able "
"to say that because their objects of study are pathetically simple in "
"comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. And it’s not "
"just psychology. Most social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics."
" Not because we’re bad experimenters, but because we’ve picked a harder "
"problem to solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it."

"To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to become "
"a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach"
" a certain level of statistical competence. In my view, there’s three "
"reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic "
"statistics:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch01_WhyStats_4.rst:46
msgid ""
"Firstly, there’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined "
"with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological "
"studies, you need to at the very least understand the basics of stats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch01_WhyStats_4.rst:51
msgid ""
"Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, "
"then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? "
"But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results "
"of statistical analyses. So if you really want to understand the psychology,"
" you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. "
"And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch01_WhyStats_4.rst:59
msgid ""
"Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other "
"people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is *expensive*. If "
"you ever get bored and want to look up how much the Australian government "
"charges for university fees, you’ll notice something interesting: statistics"
" is designated as a “national priority” category, and so the fees are much, "
"much lower than for any other area of study. This is because there’s a "
"massive shortage of statisticians out there. So, from your perspective as a "
"psychological researcher, the laws of supply and demand aren’t exactly on "
"your side here! As a result, in almost any real life situation where you "
"want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t "
"have enough money to afford a statistician. So the economics of the "
"situation mean that you have to be pretty self-sufficient."

"Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you want "
"to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be"
" able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on "
"statistics."

"Okay, now you’re just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter to "
"you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics "
"should matter to *everyone*. We live in the 21st century, and data are "
"*everywhere*. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic "
"knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! Which is "
"the topic of the next section."
