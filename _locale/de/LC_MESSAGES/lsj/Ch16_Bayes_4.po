"An important type of statistical inference problem discussed in this book is"
" the comparison between two means, discussed in some detail in the chapter "
"on *t*-tests (Chapter `Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-"
"means>`__). If you can remember back that far, you’ll recall that there are "
"several versions of the *t*-test. I’ll talk a little about Bayesian versions"
" of the independent samples *t*-tests and the paired samples *t*-test in "
"this section."

"The most common type of *t*-test is the independent samples *t*-test, and it"
" arises when you have data as in the ``harpo`` dataset that we used in the "
"earlier chapter on *t*-tests (Chapter `Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest.html"
"#comparing-two-means>`__). In this data set, we have two groups of students,"
" those who received lessons from Anastasia and those who took their classes "
"with Bernadette. The question we want to answer is whether there’s any "
"difference in the grades received by these two groups of students. Back in "
"that chapter, I suggested you could analyse this kind of data using the "
"Independent Samples *t*-test in jamovi, which gave us the results in :numref"
":`fig-bayes1`. As we obtain a *p*-value less than \\0.05, we reject the null"
" hypothesis."

"What does the Bayesian version of the *t*-test look like? We can get the "
"Bayes factor analysis by selecting the ‘Bayes factor’ checkbox under the "
"‘Tests’ option, and accepting the suggested default value for the ‘Prior’. "
"This gives the results shown in the table in :numref:`fig-bayes2`. What we "
"get in this table is a Bayes factor statistic of 1.75, meaning that the "
"evidence provided by these data are about 1.8:1 in favour of the alternative"
" hypothesis."

"Before moving on, it’s worth highlighting the difference between the "
"orthodox test results and the Bayesian one. According to the orthodox test, "
"we obtained a significant result, though only barely. Nevertheless, many "
"people would happily accept *p* = 0.043 as reasonably strong evidence for an"
" effect. In contrast, notice that the Bayesian test doesn’t even reach 2:1 "
"odds in favour of an effect, and would be considered very weak evidence at "
"best. In my experience that’s a pretty typical outcome. Bayesian methods "
"usually require more evidence before rejecting the null."

"Back in Section `The paired-samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_05.html#the-paired-"
"samples-t-test>`__ I discussed the ``chico.csv`` data set in which student "
"grades were measured on two tests, and we were interested in finding out "
"whether grades went up from test 1 to test 2. Because every student did both"
" tests, the tool we used to analyse the data was a paired samples *t*-test. "
":numref:`fig-bayes3` shows the jamovi results table for the conventional "
"paired *t*-test alongside the Bayes factor analysis. At this point, I hope "
"you can read this output without any difficulty. The data provide evidence "
"of about 6000:1 in favour of the alternative. We could probably reject the "
"null with some confidence!"

"The format of this is pretty familiar. At the bottom we have some techical "
"rubbish, and at the top we have some information about the Bayes factors. "
"What’s new is the fact that we seem to have *lots* of Bayes factors here. "

"The trick to understanding this output is to recognise that if we’re "
"interested in working out which of the 3 predictor variables are related to "
"``dan.grump``, there are actually 8 possible regression models that could be"
" considered. One possibility is the *intercept only model*, in which none of"
" the three variables have an effect. At the other end of the spectrum is the"
" *full model* in which all three variables matter. So what "
"``regressionBF()`` does is treat the *intercept only* model as the null "
"hypothesis, and print out the Bayes factors for all other models when "
"compared against that null. For example, if we look at line 4 in the table, "
"we see that the evidence is about 10\\ :sup:`33` to 1 in favour of the claim"
" that a model that includes both ``dan.sleep`` and ``day`` is better than "
"the intercept only model. Or if we look at line 1, we can see that the odds "
"are about 1.6 · 10\\ :sup:`34` that a model containing the ``dan.sleep`` "
"variable (but no others) is better than the intercept only model."
