"The normal distribution is the distribution that statistics makes most use "
"of (for reasons to be discussed shortly), and the binomial distribution is a"
" very useful one for lots of purposes. But the world of statistics is filled"
" with probability distributions, some of which we’ll run into in passing. In"
" particular, the three that will appear in this book are the *t* "
"distribution, the *χ²*-distribution and the *F*-distribution. I won’t give "
"formulas for any of these, or talk about them in too much detail, but I will"
" show you some pictures."

"The **t-distribution** is a continuous distribution that looks very similar "
"to a normal distribution, see :numref:`fig-tdist`. Note that the “tails” of "
"the *t*-distribution are “heavier” (i.e., extend further outwards) than the "
"tails of the normal distribution). That’s the important difference between "
"the two. This distribution tends to arise in situations where you think that"
" the data actually follow a normal distribution, but you don’t know the mean"
" or standard deviation. We’ll run into this distribution again in Chapter "
"`Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-means>`__."

"t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (solid line). It looks similar to a"
" normal distribution, but it’s not quite the same. For comparison purposes "
"I’ve plotted a standard normal distribution as the dashed line."

"The **χ²-distribution** is another distribution that turns up in lots of "
"different places. The situation in which we’ll see it is when doing "
"`Categorical data analysis <Ch10_ChiSquare.html#categorical-data-"
"analysis>`__, but it’s one of those things that actually pops up all over "
"the place. When you dig into the maths (and who doesn’t love doing that?), "
"it turns out that the main reason why the *χ²*-distribution turns up all "
"over the place is that if you have a bunch of variables that are normally "
"distributed, square their values and then add them up (a procedure referred "
"to as taking a “sum of squares”), this sum has a *χ²*-distribution. You’d be"
" amazed how often this fact turns out to be useful. Anyway, here’s what a "
"χ²-distribution looks like: :numref:`fig-chiSqDist`."

"χ²-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. Notice that the observed values "
"must always be greater than zero, and that the distribution is pretty "
"skewed. These are the key features of a χ²-distribution."

"The **F-distribution** looks a bit like a *χ²*-distribution, and it arises "
"whenever you need to compare two *χ²*-distributions to one another. "
"Admittedly, this doesn’t exactly sound like something that any sane person "
"would want to do, but it turns out to be very important in real world data "
"analysis. Remember when I said that *χ²* turns out to be the key "
"distribution when we’re taking a “sum of squares”? Well, what that means is "
"if you want to compare two different “sums of squares”, you’re probably "
"talking about something that has an *F*-distribution. Of course, as yet I "
"still haven’t given you an example of anything that involves a sum of "
"squares, but I will in Chapter `Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) "
"<Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__. And that’s where"
" we’ll run into the *F*-distribution. Oh, and there’s a picture in :numref"
":`fig-Fdist`."

"F-distribution with 3 and 5 degrees of freedom. Qualitatively speaking, it "

"Okay, time to wrap this section up. We’ve seen three new distributions: "
"*χ²*, *t* and *F*. They’re all continuous distributions, and they’re all "
"closely related to the normal distribution. The main thing for our purposes "
"is that you grasp the basic idea that these distributions are all deeply "
"related to one another, and to the normal distribution. Later on in this "
"book we’re going to run into data that are normally distributed, or at least"
" assumed to be normally distributed. What I want you to understand right now"
" is that, if you make the assumption that your data are normally "
"distributed, you shouldn’t be surprised to see *χ²*-, *t*-and "
"*F*-distributions popping up all over the place when you start trying to do "
"your data analysis."
