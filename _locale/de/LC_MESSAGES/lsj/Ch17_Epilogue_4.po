"**Missing data.** Suppose you’re doing a survey, and you’re interested in "
"exercise and weight. You send data to four people. Adam says he exercises a "
"lot and is not overweight. Briony says she exercises a lot and is not "
"overweight. Carol says she does not exercise and is overweight. Dan says he "
"does not exercise and refuses to answer the question about his weight. "
"Elaine does not return the survey. You now have a missing data problem. "
"There is one entire survey missing, and one question missing from another "
"one, What do you do about it? Ignoring missing data is not, in general, a "
"safe thing to do. Let’s think about Dan’s survey here. Firstly, notice that,"
" on the basis of my other responses, I appear to be more similar to Carol "
"(neither of us exercise) than to Adam or Briony. So if you were forced to "
"guess my weight, you’d guess that I’m closer to her than to them. Maybe "
"you’d make some correction for the fact that Adam and I are males and Briony"
" and Carol are females. The statistical name for this kind of guessing is "
"“imputation”. Doing imputation safely is hard, but it’s important, "
"especially when the missing data are missing in a systematic way. Because of"
" the fact that people who are overweight are often pressured to feel poorly "
"about their weight (often thanks to public health campaigns), we actually "
"have reason to suspect that the people who are not responding are more "
"likely to be overweight than the people who do respond. Imputing a weight to"
" Dan means that the number of overweight people in the sample will probably "
"rise from 1 out of 3 (if we ignore Dan), to 2 out of 4 (if we impute Dan’s "
"weight). Clearly this matters. But doing it sensibly is more complicated "
"than it sounds. Earlier, I suggested you should treat me like Carol, since "
"we gave the same answer to the exercise question. But that’s not quite "
"right. There is a systematic difference between us. She answered the "
"question, and I didn’t. Given the social pressures faced by overweight "
"people, isn’t it likely that I’m *more* overweight than Carol? And of course"
" this is still ignoring the fact that it’s not sensible to impute a *single*"
" weight to me, as if you actually knew my weight. Instead, what you need to "
"do it is impute a range of plausible guesses (referred to as multiple "
"imputation), in order to capture the fact that you’re more uncertain about "
"my weight than you are about Carol’s. And let’s not get started on the "
"problem posed by the fact that Elaine didn’t send in the survey. As you can "
"probably guess, dealing with missing data is an increasingly important "
"topic. In fact, I’ve been told that a lot of journals in some fields will "
"not accept studies that have missing data unless some kind of sensible "
"multiple imputation scheme is followed."

"**Power analysis.** In Chapter `Hypothesis testing "
"<Ch09_HypothesisTesting.html#hypothesis-testing>`__ I discussed the concept "
"of power (i.e., how likely are you to be able to detect an effect if it "
"actually exists) and referred to power analysis, a collection of tools that "
"are useful for assessing how much power your study has. Power analysis can "
"be useful for planning a study (e.g., figuring out how large a sample you’re"
" likely to need), but it also serves a useful role in analysing data that "
"you already collected. For instance, suppose you get a significant result, "
"and you have an estimate of your effect size. You can use this information "
"to estimate how much power your study actually had. This is kind of useful, "
"especially if your effect size is not large. For instance, suppose you "
"reject the null hypothesis at p < 0.05, but you use power analysis to figure"
" out that your estimated power was only 0.08. The significant result means "
"that, if the null hypothesis was in fact true, there was a 5% chance of "
"getting data like this. But the low power means that, even if the null "
"hypothesis is false and the effect size was really as small as it looks, "
"there was only an 8% chance of getting data like you did. This suggests that"
" you need to be pretty cautious, because luck seems to have played a big "
"part in your results, one way or the other!"

"**Data analysis using theory-inspired models.** In a few places in this book"
" I’ve mentioned response time (RT) data, where you record how long it takes "
"someone to do something (e.g., make a simple decision). I’ve mentioned that "
"RT data are almost invariably non-normal, and positively skewed. "
"Additionally, there’s a thing known as the speed-accuracy trade-off: if you "
"try to make decisions too quickly (low RT) then you’re likely to make poorer"
" decisions (lower accuracy). So if you measure both the accuracy of a "
"participant’s decisions and their RT, you’ll probably find that speed and "
"accuracy are related. There’s more to the story than this, of course, "
"because some people make better decisions than others regardless of how fast"
" they’re going. Moreover, speed depends on both cognitive processes (i.e., "
"time spent thinking) but also physiological ones (e.g., how fast can you "
"move your muscles). It’s starting to sound like analysing this data will be "
"a complicated process. And indeed it is, but one of the things that you find"
" when you dig into the psychological literature is that there already exist "
"mathematical models (called “sequential sampling models”) that describe how "
"people make simple decisions, and these models take into account a lot of "
"the factors I mentioned above. You won’t find any of these theoretically-"
"inspired models in a standard statistics textbook. Standard stats textbooks "
"describe standard tools, tools that could meaningfully be applied in lots of"
" different disciplines, not just psychology. ANOVA is an example of a "
"standard tool that is just as applicable to psychology as to pharmacology. "
"Sequential sampling models are not, they are psychology-specific, more or "
"less. This doesn’t make them less powerful tools. In fact, if you’re "
"analysing data where people have to make choices quickly you should really "
"be using sequential sampling models to analyse the data. Using ANOVA or "
"regression or whatever won’t work as well, because the theoretical "
"assumptions that underpin them are not well-matched to your data. In "
"contrast, sequential sampling models were explicitly designed to analyse "
"this specific type of data, and their theoretical assumptions are "
"*extremely* well-matched to the data."
