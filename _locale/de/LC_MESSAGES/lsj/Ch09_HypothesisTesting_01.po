"Eventually we all succumb to madness. For me, that day will arrive once I’m "

"Let’s suppose that this glorious day has come. My first study is a simple "
"one in which I seek to test whether clairvoyance exists. Each participant "
"sits down at a table and is shown a card by an experimenter. The card is "
"black on one side and white on the other. The experimenter takes the card "
"away and places it on a table in an adjacent room. The card is placed black "
"side up or white side up completely at random, with the randomisation "
"occurring only after the experimenter has left the room with the "
"participant. A second experimenter comes in and asks the participant which "
"side of the card is now facing upwards. It’s purely a one-shot experiment. "
"Each person sees only one card and gives only one answer, and at no stage is"
" the participant actually in contact with someone who knows the right "
"answer. My data set, therefore, is very simple. I have asked the question of"
" *N* people and some number *X* of these people have given the correct "
"response. To make things concrete, let’s suppose that I have tested *N* = "
"100 people and *X* = 62 of these got the answer right. A surprisingly large "
"number, sure, but is it large enough for me to feel safe in claiming I’ve "
"found evidence for ESP? This is the situation where hypothesis testing comes"
" in useful. However, before we talk about how to *test* hypotheses, we need "
"to be clear about what we mean by hypotheses."

"The first distinction that you need to keep clear in your mind is between "
"research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. In my ESP study my overall "
"scientific goal is to demonstrate that clairvoyance exists. In this "
"situation I have a clear research goal: I am hoping to discover evidence for"
" ESP. In other situations I might actually be a lot more neutral than that, "
"so I might say that my research goal is to determine whether or not "
"clairvoyance exists. Regardless of how I want to portray myself, the basic "
"point that I’m trying to convey here is that a research hypothesis involves "
"making a substantive, testable scientific claim. If you are a psychologist "
"then your research hypotheses are fundamentally *about* psychological "
"constructs. Any of the following would count as **research hypotheses**:"

"*Listening to music reduces your ability to pay attention to other things.* "

"*Intelligence is speed of information processing*. This hypothesis has a "
"quite different character. It’s not actually a relational claim at all. It’s"
" an ontological claim about the fundamental character of intelligence (and "
"I’m pretty sure it’s wrong). It’s worth expanding on this one actually. It’s"
" usually easier to think about how to construct experiments to test research"
" hypotheses of the form “does X affect Y?” than it is to address claims like"
" “what is X?” And in practice what usually happens is that you find ways of "
"testing relational claims that follow from your ontological ones. For "
"instance, if I believe that intelligence *is* speed of information "
"processing in the brain, my experiments will often involve looking for "
"relationships between measures of intelligence and measures of speed. As a "
"consequence most everyday research questions do tend to be relational in "
"nature, but they’re almost always motivated by deeper ontological questions "
"about the state of nature."

"Notice that in practice, my research hypotheses could overlap a lot. My "
"ultimate goal in the ESP experiment might be to test an ontological claim "
"like “ESP exists”, but I might operationally restrict myself to a narrower "
"hypothesis like “Some people can ‘see’ objects in a clairvoyant fashion”. "
"That said, there are some things that really don’t count as proper research "
"hypotheses in any meaningful sense:"

"*Love is a battlefield*. This is too vague to be testable. Whilst it’s okay "
"for a research hypothesis to have a degree of vagueness to it, it has to be "
"possible to operationalise your theoretical ideas. Maybe I’m just not "
"creative enough to see it, but I can’t see how this can be converted into "
"any concrete research design. If that’s true then this isn’t a scientific "
"research hypothesis, it’s a pop song. That doesn’t mean it’s not "
"interesting. A lot of deep questions that humans have fall into this "
"category. Maybe one day science will be able to construct testable theories "
"of love, or to test to see if God exists, and so on. But right now we can’t,"
" and I wouldn’t bet on ever seeing a satisfying scientific approach to "
"either."

"*The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology club*. This"
" is not a substantive claim of any kind. It’s true by definition. No "
"conceivable state of nature could possibly be inconsistent with this claim. "

"the domain of science. Whatever else you do in science your claims must have"

"*More people in my experiment will say “yes” than “no”*. This one fails as a"
" research hypothesis because it’s a claim about the data set, not about the "
"psychology (unless of course your actual research question is whether people"
" have some kind of “yes” bias!). Actually, this hypothesis is starting to "

"As you can see, research hypotheses can be somewhat messy at times and "
"ultimately they are *scientific* claims. **Statistical hypotheses** are "
"neither of these two things. Statistical hypotheses must be mathematically "
"precise and they must correspond to specific claims about the "
"characteristics of the data generating mechanism (i.e., the “population”). "
"Even so, the intent is that statistical hypotheses bear a clear relationship"
" to the substantive research hypotheses that you care about! For instance, "
"in my ESP study my research hypothesis is that some people are able to see "
"through walls or whatever. What I want to do is to “map” this onto a "
"statement about how the data were generated. So let’s think about what that "
"statement would be. The quantity that I’m interested in within the "
"experiment is *P*\\ (“correct”), the true-but-unknown probability with which"
" the participants in my experiment answer the question correctly. Let’s use "
"the Greek letter *θ* (theta) to refer to this probability. Here are four "
"different statistical hypotheses:"

"If ESP doesn’t exist and if my experiment is well designed then my "
"participants are just guessing. So I should expect them to get it right half"

"Alternatively, suppose ESP does exist and participants can see the card. If "
"that’s true people will perform better than chance and the statistical "
"hypothesis is that *θ* > 0.5\\ ."

"A third possibility is that ESP does exist, but the colours are all reversed"
" and people don’t realise it (okay, that’s wacky, but you never know). If "
"that’s how it works then you’d expect people’s performance to be *below* "
"chance. This would correspond to a statistical hypothesis that *θ* < 0.5\\ ."

"Finally, suppose ESP exists but I have no idea whether people are seeing the"
" right colour or the wrong one. In that case the only claim I could make "
"about the data would be that the probability of making the correct answer is"
" *not* equal to 0.5. This corresponds to the statistical hypothesis that *θ*"
" ≠ 0.5\\ ."

"What this discussion makes clear, I hope, is that when attempting to "
"construct a statistical hypothesis test the researcher actually has two "

"statistical hypothesis (a claim about the data generating population). In my"

"So far, so good. I have a research hypothesis that corresponds to what I "
"want to believe about the world, and I can map it onto a statistical "
"hypothesis that corresponds to what I want to believe about how the data "
"were generated. It’s at this point that things get somewhat counter-"
"intuitive for a lot of people. Because what I’m about to do is invent a new "
"statistical hypothesis (the “null” hypothesis, H\\ :sub:`0`\\ ) that "
"corresponds to the exact opposite of what I want to believe, and then focus "
"exclusively on that almost to the neglect of the thing I’m actually "
"interested in (which is now called the “alternative” hypothesis, H\\ "
":sub:`1`\\ ). In our ESP example, the null hypothesis is that *θ* = 0.5, "
"since that’s what we’d expect if ESP *didn’t* exist. My hope, of course, is "
"that ESP is totally real and so the *alternative* to this null hypothesis is"
" *θ* ≠ 0.5. In essence, what we’re doing here is dividing up the possible "
"values of *θ* into two groups: those values that I really hope aren’t true "
"(the null), and those values that I’d be happy with if they turn out to be "
"right (the alternative). Having done so, the important thing to recognise is"
" that the goal of a hypothesis test is *not* to show that the alternative "
"hypothesis is (probably) true. The goal is to show that the null hypothesis "
"is (probably) false. Most people find this pretty weird."

"The best way to think about it, in my experience, is to imagine that a "
"hypothesis test is a criminal trial\\ [#]_, *the trial of the null "
"hypothesis*. The null hypothesis is the defendant, the researcher is the "
"prosecutor, and the statistical test itself is the judge. Just like a "
"criminal trial, there is a presumption of innocence. The null hypothesis is "
"*deemed* to be true unless you, the researcher, can prove beyond a "
"reasonable doubt that it is false. You are free to design your experiment "
"however you like (within reason, obviously!) and your goal when doing so is "
"to maximise the chance that the data will yield a conviction for the crime "
"of being false. The catch is that the statistical test sets the rules of the"
" trial and those rules are designed to protect the null hypothesis, "
"specifically to ensure that if the null hypothesis is actually true the "
"chances of a false conviction are guaranteed to be low. This is pretty "
"important. After all, the null hypothesis doesn’t get a lawyer, and given "
"that the researcher is trying desperately to prove it to be false *someone* "
"has to protect it."
