"In this chapter I’ve covered two main topics. The first half of the chapter "
"talks about sampling theory, and the second half talks about how we can use "
"sampling theory to construct estimates of the population parameters. The "
"section breakdown looks like this:"

"As always, there’s a lot of topics related to sampling and estimation that "
"aren’t covered in this chapter, but for an introductory psychology class "
"this is fairly comprehensive I think. For most applied researchers you won’t"
" need much more theory than this. One big question that I haven’t touched on"
" in this chapter is what you do when you don’t have a simple random sample. "
"There is a lot of statistical theory you can draw on to handle this "
"situation, but it’s well beyond the scope of this book."
