"Visualising data is one of the most important tasks facing the data analyst."
" It’s important for two distinct but closely related reasons. Firstly, "
"there’s the matter of drawing “presentation graphics”, displaying your data "
"in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it easier for your reader to "
"understand what you’re trying to tell them. Equally important, perhaps even "
"more important, is the fact that drawing graphs helps *you* to understand "
"the data. To that end, it’s important to draw “exploratory graphics” that "
"help you learn about the data as you go about analysing it. These points "
"might seem pretty obvious but I cannot count the number of times I’ve seen "
"people forget them."

"To give a sense of the importance of this chapter, I want to start with a "
"classic illustration of just how powerful a good graph can be. To that end, "
":numref:`fig-snowMap` shows a redrawing of one of the most famous data "
"visualisations of all time. This is John Snow’s 1854 map of cholera deaths. "
"The map is elegant in its simplicity. In the background we have a street map"
" which helps orient the viewer. Over the top we see a large number of small "
"dots, each one representing the location of a cholera case. The larger "
"symbols show the location of water pumps, labelled by name. Even the most "
"casual inspection of the graph makes it very clear that the source of the "
"outbreak is almost certainly the Broad Street pump. Upon viewing this graph "
"Dr Snow arranged to have the handle removed from the pump and ended the "
"outbreak that had killed over 500 people. Such is the power of a good data "
"visualisation."

"Stylised redrawing of John Snow’s original cholera map. Each small dot "
"represents the location of a cholera case and each large circle shows the "
"location of a well. As the plot makes clear, the cholera outbreak is centred"
" very closely on the Broad St pump."

"The goals in this chapter are twofold. First, to discuss several fairly "
"standard graphs that we use a lot when analysing and presenting data, and "
"second to show you how to create these graphs in jamovi. The graphs "
"themselves tend to be pretty straightforward, so in one respect this chapter"
" is pretty simple. Where people usually struggle is learning how to produce "
"graphs, and especially learning how to produce good graphs. Fortunately, "
"learning how to draw graphs in jamovi is reasonably simple as long as you’re"
" not too picky about what your graph looks like. What I mean when I say this"
" is that jamovi has a lot of *very* good default graphs, or plots, that most"
" of the time produce a clean, high-quality graphic. However, on those "
"occasions when you do want to do something non-standard, or if you need to "
"make highly specific changes to the figure, then the graphics functionality "
"in jamovi is not yet capable of supporting advanced work or detail editing."
