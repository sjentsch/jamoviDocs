"In this chapter on factor analysis and related techniques we have introduced"
" and demonstrated statistical analyses that assess the pattern of "
"relationships in a data set. Specifically, we have covered:"

"`Exploratory Factor Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1.html#exploratory-factor-"
"analysis>`__  (EFA). EFA is a statistical technique for identifying "
"underlying latent factors in a data set. Each observed variable is "
"conceptualised as representing the latent factor to some extent, indicated "
"by a factor loading. Researchers also use EFA as a way of data reduction, "
"i.e. identifying observed variables than can be combined into new factor "
"variables for subsequent analysis."

"`Principal Component Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_2.html#principal-"
"component-analysis>`__ (PCA) is a data reduction technique which, strictly "
"speaking, does not identify underlying latent factors. Instead, PCA simply "
"produces a linear combination of observed variables."

"`Confirmatory Factor Analysis <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_3.html#confirmatory-"
"factor-analysis>`__ (CFA). Unlike EFA, with CFA you start with an idea - a "
"model - of how the variables in your data are related to each other. You "
"then test your model against the observed data and assess how good a fit the"
" model is to the data."

"In `Multi-Trait Multi-Method (MTMM) CFA <Ch15_FactorAnalysis_4.html#multi-"
"trait-multi-method-cfa>`__, both latent factor and method variance are "
"included in the model in an approach that is useful when there are different"
" methodological approaches used and therefore method variance is an "
"important consideration."

"analysis tests how consistently a scale measures a measurement "
