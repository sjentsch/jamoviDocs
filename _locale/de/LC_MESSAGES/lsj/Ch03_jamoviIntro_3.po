"Sometimes you want to change the variable level. This can happen for all "
"sorts of reasons. Sometimes when you import data from files, it can come to "
"you in the wrong format. Numbers sometimes get imported as nominal, text "
"values. Dates may get imported as text. ParticipantID values can sometimes "
"be read as continuous: nominal values can sometimes be read as ordinal or "
"even continuous. There’s a good chance that sometimes you’ll want to convert"
" a variable from one measurement level into another one. Or, to use the "
"correct term, you want to **coerce** the variable from one class into "
"another."

"In `The spreadsheet <Ch03_jamoviIntro_2.html#the-spreadsheet>`__ we saw how "
"to specify different variable levels, and if you want to change a variable’s"
" measurement level then you can do this in the jamovi data view for that "
"variable. Just click the check box for the measurement level you want - "
"continuous, ordinal, or nominal."

"A really great feature of jamovi is the ability to install add-on modules "
"from the jamovi library. These add-on modules have been developed by the "
"jamovi community, i.e., jamovi users and developers who have created special"
" software add-ons that do other, usually more advanced, analyses that go "
"beyond the capabilities of the base jamovi program."

"To install add-on modules, just click on the large “+” in the top right of "
"the jamovi window, select “jamovi-library” and then browse through the "
"various add-on modules that are available. Choose the one(s) you want, and "
"then install them, as in :numref:`fig-modules`."

"It’s that easy. The newly installed modules can then be accessed from the "
"“Analyses” button bar. Try it... useful add-on modules to install include "
"”scatr” (added under “Descriptives”) and “Rj”."

"There’s one last thing I should cover in this chapter: how to quit jamovi. "
"It’s not hard, just close the program the same way you would any other "
"program. However, what you might want to do before you quit is save your "
"work! There are two parts to this: saving any changes to the data set, and "
"saving the analyses that you ran."

msgid ""
"It is good practice to save any changes to the data set as a *new* data set."
" That way you can always go back to the original data. To save any changes "
"in jamovi, select ``Export`` → ``Data`` from the main jamovi menu (button "
"with three horizontal bars in the top left) and create a new file name for "
"the changed data set."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch03_jamoviIntro_3.rst:67
msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can save *both* the changed data and any analyses you "
"have undertaken by saving as a jamovi file. To do this, from the main jamovi"
" menu select ``Save as`` and type in a file name for this ``jamovi file "
"(.omv)``. Remember to save the file in a location where you can find it "
"again later. I usually create a new folder for specific data sets and "
"analyses."
