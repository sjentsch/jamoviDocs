"Calculating some basic descriptive statistics is one of the very first "
"things you do when analysing real data, and descriptive statistics are much "
"simpler to understand than inferential statistics, so like every other "
"statistics textbook I’ve started with descriptives. In this chapter, we "
"talked about the following topics:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Measures of central tendency <Ch04_Descriptives_1.html#measures-of-central-"
"tendency>`__: Broadly speaking, central tendency measures tell you where the"
" data are. There’s three measures that are typically reported in the "
"literature: the mean, median and mode."

#: ../../lsj/Ch04_Descriptives_6.rst:16
msgid ""
"`Measures of variability <Ch04_Descriptives_2.html#measures-of-"
"variability>`__: In contrast, measures of variability tell you about how "
"“spread out” the data are. The key measures are: range, standard deviation, "
"and interquartile range."

#: ../../lsj/Ch04_Descriptives_6.rst:20

"`Measures of skewness and kurtosis <Ch04_Descriptives_3.html#measures-of-"
"skewness-and-kurtosis>`__: We also looked at assymetry in a variable’s "
"distribution (skew) and pointness (kurtosis)."

"`Getting group summaries of variables in jamovi <Ch04_Descriptives_4.html"
"#getting-group-summaries-of-variables-in-jamovi>`__: Since this book focuses"
" on doing data analysis in jamovi, we spent a bit of time talking about how "
"descriptive statistics are computed for different subgroups."

"`Standard scores <Ch04_Descriptives_5.html#standard-scores>`__: The "
"*z*-score is a slightly unusual beast. It’s not quite a descriptive "
"statistic, and not quite an inference. Make sure you understand that "
"section. It’ll come up again later."

"In the next Chapter we’ll move on to a discussion of how to draw pictures! "
"Everyone loves a pretty picture, right? But before we do, I want to end on "
"an important point. A traditional first course in statistics spends only a "
"small proportion of the class on descriptive statistics, maybe one or two "
"lectures at most. The vast majority of the lecturer’s time is spent on "
"inferential statistics because that’s where all the hard stuff is. That "
"makes sense, but it hides the practical everyday importance of choosing good"
" descriptives. With that in mind…"

"Stalin’s infamous quote about the statistical character of the deaths of "
"millions is worth giving some thought. The clear intent of his statement is "
"that the death of an individual touches us personally and its force cannot "
"be denied, but that the deaths of a multitude are incomprehensible and as a "
"consequence are mere statistics and more easily ignored. I’d argue that "
"Stalin was half right. A statistic is an abstraction, a description of "
"events beyond our personal experience, and so hard to visualise. Few if any "
"of us can imagine what the deaths of millions is “really” like, but we can "
"imagine one death and this gives the lone death its feeling of immediate "
"tragedy, a feeling that is missing from Ellman’s cold statistical "
"description."

"Yet it is not so simple. Without numbers, without counts, without a "
"description of what happened, we have *no chance* of understanding what "
"really happened, no opportunity even to try to summon the missing feeling. "
"And in truth, as I write this sitting in comfort on a Saturday morning half "
"a world and a whole lifetime away from the Gulags, when I put the Ellman "
"estimate next to the Stalin quote a dull dread settles in my stomach and a "
"chill settles over me. The Stalinist repression is something truly beyond my"
" experience, but with a combination of statistical data and those recorded "
"personal histories that have come down to us, it is not entirely beyond my "
"comprehension. Because what Ellman’s numbers tell us is this: over a two "
"year period Stalinist repression wiped out the equivalent of every man, "
"woman and child currently alive in the city where I live. Each one of those "
"deaths had it’s own story, was it’s own tragedy, and only some of those are "
"known to us now. Even so, with a few carefully chosen statistics, the scale "
"of the atrocity starts to come into focus."

"Thus it is no small thing to say that the first task of the statistician and"
" the scientist is to summarise the data, to find some collection of numbers "
"that can convey to an audience a sense of what has happened. This is the job"
" of descriptive statistics, but it’s not a job that can be told solely using"
" the numbers. You are a data analyst, and not a statistical software "
"package. Part of your job is to take these *statistics* and turn them into a"
" *description*. When you analyse data it is not sufficient to list off a "
"collection of numbers. Always remember that what you’re really trying to do "
"is communicate with a human audience. The numbers are important, but they "
"need to be put together into a meaningful story that your audience can "
"interpret. That means you need to think about framing. You need to think "
"about context. And you need to think about the individual events that your "
"statistics are summarising."
