"Even within the topics that I have covered in the book, there are a lot of "
"omissions that I’d like to redress in future version of the book. Just "
"sticking to things that are purely about statistics (rather than things "
"associated with jamovi), the following is a representative but not "
"exhaustive list of topics that I’d like to expand on at some time:"

"**Other types of correlations.** In Chapter `Correlation and linear "
"regression <Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__ I "
"talked about two types of correlation: Pearson and Spearman. Both of these "
"methods of assessing correlation are applicable to the case where you have "
"two continuous variables and want to assess the relationship between them. "
"What about the case where your variables are both nominal scale? Or when one"
" is nominal scale and the other is continuous? There are actually methods "
"for computing correlations in such cases (e.g., polychoric correlation), and"
" it would be good to see these included."

"**More detail on effect sizes.** In general, I think the treatment of effect"
" sizes throughout the book is a little more cursory than it should be. In "
"almost every instance, I’ve tended just to pick one measure of effect size "
"(usually the most popular one) and describe that. However, for almost all "
"tests and models there are multiple ways of thinking about effect size, and "
"I’d like to go into more detail in the future."

"**Dealing with violated assumptions.** In a number of places in the book "
"I’ve talked about some things you can do when you find that the assumptions "
"of your test (or model) are violated, but I think that I ought to say more "
"about this. In particular, I think it would have been nice to talk in a lot "
"more detail about how you can tranform variables to fix problems. I talked a"
" bit about this in the sections `Transforming or recoding a variable "
"<Ch06_DataHandling_3.html#transforming-or-recoding-a-variable>`__ and "
"`Mathematical functions and operations <Ch06_DataHandling_4.html#a-few-more-"
"mathematical-functions-and-operations>`__, but the discussion isn’t detailed"
" enough I think."

"**Interaction terms for regression.** In Chapter `Factorial ANOVA "
"<Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__, I talked about the fact that you can "
"have interaction terms in an ANOVA, and I also pointed out that ANOVA can be"
" interpreted as a kind of linear regression model. Yet, when talking about "
"regression in Chapter `Correlation and linear regression "
"<Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression>`__ I made not "
"mention of interactions at all. However, there’s nothing stopping you from "
"including interaction terms in a regression model. It’s just a little more "
"complicated to figure out what an “interaction” actually means when you’re "
"talking about the interaction between two continuous predictors, and it can "
"be done in more than one way. Even so, I would have liked to talk a little "
"about this."

"**Method of planned comparison.** As I mentioned this in Chapter `Factorial "
"ANOVA <Ch14_ANOVA2.html#factorial-anova>`__, it’s not always appropriate to "
"be using a post-hoc correction like Tukey’s HSD when doing an ANOVA, "
"especially when you had a very clear (and limited) set of comparisons that "
"you cared about ahead of time. I would like to talk more about this in the "
"future."

"**Multiple comparison methods.** Even within the context of talking about "
"post-hoc tests and multiple comparisons, I would have liked to talk about "
"the methods in more detail, and talk about what other methods exist besides "
"the few options I mentioned."
