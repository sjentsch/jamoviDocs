"Any time that you get a new data set to look at one of the first tasks that "
"you have to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily "
"understood fashion. This is what **descriptive statistics** (as opposed to "
"inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people the term "
"“statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics. It is this topic "
"that we’ll consider in this chapter, but before going into any details, "
"let’s take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To"
" do this, let’s open the ``aflsmall_margins`` file and see what variables "
"are stored in the file."

"In fact, there is just one variable here, ``afl.margins``. We’ll focus a bit"
" on this variable in this chapter, so I’d better tell you what it is. Unlike"
" most of the data sets in this book, this is actually real data, relating to"
" the Australian Football League (AFL).\\ [#]_ The ``afl.margins`` variable "
"contains the winning margin (number of points) for all 176 home and away "
"games played during the 2010 season."

"This output doesn’t make it easy to get a sense of what the data are "
"actually saying. Just “looking at the data” isn’t a terribly effective way "
"of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what the data are "
"actually saying we need to calculate some descriptive statistics (this "
"chapter) and draw some nice pictures (Chapter `Drawing graphs "
"<Ch05_Graphics.html>`__). Since the descriptive statistics are the easier of"
" the two topics I’ll start with those, but nevertheless I’ll show you a "
"histogram of the ``afl.margins`` data since it should help you get a sense "
"of what the data we’re trying to describe actually look like, see :numref"
":`fig-aflMargins`. We’ll talk a lot more about how to draw `histograms "
"<Ch05_Graphics_1.html#histograms>`__. For now, it’s enough to look at the "
"histogram and note that it provides a fairly interpretable representation of"
" the ``afl.margins`` data."
