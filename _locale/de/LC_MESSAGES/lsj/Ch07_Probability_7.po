"In this chapter we’ve talked about probability. We’ve talked about what "
"probability means and why statisticians can’t agree on what it means. We "
"talked about the rules that probabilities have to obey. And we introduced "
"the idea of a probability distribution and spent a good chunk of the chapter"
" talking about some of the more important probability distributions that "
"statisticians work with. The section by section breakdown looks like this:"

"As you’d expect, my coverage is by no means exhaustive. Probability theory "
"is a large branch of mathematics in its own right, entirely separate from "
"its application to statistics and data analysis. As such, there are "
"thousands of books written on the subject and universities generally offer "
"multiple classes devoted entirely to probability theory. Even the “simpler” "
"task of documenting standard probability distributions is a big topic. I’ve "
"described five standard probability distributions in this chapter, but "
"sitting on my bookshelf I have a 45-chapter book called “Statistical "
"Distributions” (`Evans, 2000 <References.html#evans-2000>`__\\ ) that lists "
"a *lot* more than that. Fortunately for you, very little of this is "
"necessary. You’re unlikely to need to know dozens of statistical "
"distributions when you go out and do real world data analysis, and you "
"definitely won’t need them for this book, but it never hurts to know that "
"there’s other possibilities out there."

"Picking up on that last point, there’s a sense in which this whole chapter "
"is something of a digression. Many undergraduate psychology classes on "
"statistics skim over this content very quickly (I know mine did), and even "
"the more advanced classes will often “forget” to revisit the basic "
"foundations of the field. Most academic psychologists would not know the "
"difference between probability and density, and until recently very few "
"would have been aware of the difference between Bayesian and frequentist "
"probability. However, I think it’s important to understand these things "
"before moving onto the applications. For example, there are a lot of rules "
"about what you’re “allowed” to say when doing statistical inference and many"
" of these can seem arbitrary and weird. However, they start to make sense if"
" you understand that there is this Bayesian / frequentist distinction. "
"Similarly, in Chapter `Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-two-"
"means>`__ we’re going to talk about something called the *t*-test, and if "
"you really want to have a grasp of the mechanics of the *t*-test it really "
"helps to have a sense of what a *t*-distribution actually looks like. You "
"get the idea, I hope."
