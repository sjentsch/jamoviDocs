"Suppose you’ve become involved in a clinical trial in which you are testing "
"a new antidepressant drug called *Joyzepam*. In order to construct a fair "
"test of the drug’s effectiveness, the study involves three separate drugs to"
" be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing "
"antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called *Anxifree*. A collection of 18 "
"participants with moderate to severe depression are recruited for your "
"initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in conjunction"
" with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing "
"cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are "
"randomly assigned (doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there "
"are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A "
"psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3 month run with each "
"drug, and the overall *improvement* in each person’s mood is assessed on a "
"scale ranging from -5 to +5. With that as the study design, let’s now load "
"up the data file in ``clinicaltrial.csv``. We can see that this data set "
"contains the three variables ``drug``, ``therapy`` and ``mood.gain``."

"For the purposes of this chapter, what we’re really interested in is the "
"effect of ``drug`` on ``mood.gain``. The first thing to do is calculate some"
" descriptive statistics and draw some graphs. In `Descriptive statistics "
"<Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-statistics>`__ we showed you how to do "
"this, and some of the descriptive statistics we can calculate in jamovi are "
"shown in :numref`fig-anova1`."

"As the plot makes clear, there is a larger improvement in mood for "
"participants in the Joyzepam group than for either the Anxifree group or the"
" placebo group. The Anxifree group shows a larger mood gain than the control"
" group, but the difference isn’t as large. The question that we want to "
"answer is are these difference “real”, or are they just due to chance?"
