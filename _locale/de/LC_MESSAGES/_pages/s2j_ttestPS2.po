"The results from SPSS and jamovi are identical, but they are arranged "
"slightly differently. SPSS gives the mean difference (blue box) first, "
"before giving the t-statistics and their respective degrees of freedom "
"and p-value (red box), in jamovi it is the other way round (statistics – "
"red box – first and mean difference – blue box – afterwards). Another "
"table underneath (green box) gives the descriptive statistics for the two"
" variables that were compared. Except from that jamovi also reports the "
"Median, and a slightly different way to arrange the columns (SPSS begins "
"with the ``Mean`` and has the ``N`` afterwards, jamovi vice versa) the "
"two tables are identical. The numerical values for the statistics are "
"identical: *t* = -3.804, *df* = 11, *p* = 0.003."
