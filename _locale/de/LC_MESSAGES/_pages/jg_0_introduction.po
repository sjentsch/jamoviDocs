"The aim of the following section is to provide short, non-technical "
"tutorials on how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi. It "
"was originally created by Jonas Rafi under the name jamovi guide. "
"However, it is meant to be an introduction, not a resource providing an "
"in-depth introduction into the background of those procedures. For such "
"an endevaour, there are plenty of other resources. Some of these "
"resources are listed at the bottom of the pages introducing the "
"individual analyses in the box “Community resources”."

"The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that examines "
"how the impact of one or more factors affects an outcome (dependent) "
"variable. These factors are the predictor variables and are categorical. "
"Typically, such factors reflect an experimental manipulation (e.g. with "
"or without treatment), but a factor can also represent groups for whose "
"influence one would like to control (e.g. gender: men or women). The "
"analysis of variance is based on a concept similar to that of the t-test,"
" but it goes beyond that, in that factors can have several levels "
"(t-tests only allow two) and in that several factors can be examined "
"simultaneously."

"Correlation and regression analyses are statistical methods for assessing"
" the relationships between a dependent / outcome variable and one or more"
" independent / predictor variables. While the *correlation* analysis "
"examines the *relationship* between one predictor and one outcome "
"variable, *regression* analysis mainly focuses on *prediction* (how well "
"can one or more variables predict another (outcome) variable). Often, a "
"distinction is made between linear and non-linear (e.g., logistic "
"regression)."
