"The aim of the following section is to provide short, non-technical "
"tutorials on how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi, and "
"was originally created by Jonas Rafi under the name jamovi guide. "
"However, this is only intended as a brief overview. For a more in-depth "
"treatment of these analyses, we'd recommend you take a look at the many "
"`community resources <https://www.jamovi.org/community.html>`__ "

"The following documentation describes each of the analyses, and describes"
" the variable measure types required. For example, it might explain that "
"a particular analysis requires a continuous |continuous| dependent "
"variable, and a nominal |nominal| grouping variable. However it's "
"possible that the columns in your data set, for a number of different "
"reasons, aren't set up with the correct measure types (as indicated in "
"the column header). You can adjust the measure type of columns using the "
"variable editor, however (for the most part) these measure types are "
"really just a guide and don't need to be set correctly. If you assign a "
"|continuous| continuous variable to an analysis expecting a |nominal| "
"nominal one, the analysis will simply treat the variable as nominal."

"All this to say, if the documentation says that a particular measure type"
" is required, the data simply needs to be the correct 'shape', and you "
"can save yourself the labour of setting the measure types correctly if "
"you don't want to."

msgid ""
"The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that examines "
"how the impact of one or more factors affects an outcome (dependent) "
"variable. These factors are the predictor variables and are categorical. "
"Typically, such factors reflect an experimental manipulation (e.g. with "
"or without treatment), but a factor can also represent groups for whose "
"influence one would like to control (e.g. gender: men or women). The "
"analysis of variance is based on a concept similar to that of the t-test,"
" but it goes beyond that, in that factors can have several levels "
"(t-tests only allow two) and in that several factors can be examined "
"simultaneously."

"There are different types of analysis of variance, which differ in the "

"Correlation and regression analyses are statistical methods for assessing"
" the relationships between a dependent / outcome variable and one or more"
" independent / predictor variables. While the *correlation* analysis "
"examines the *relationship* between one predictor and one outcome "
"variable, *regression* analysis mainly focuses on *prediction* (how well "
"can one or more variables predict another (outcome) variable). Often, a "
"distinction is made between linear and non-linear (e.g., logistic "
"regression)."
