"The real power of using jamovi and the jmv-library (described below) "
"comes with the opportunity to integrate it with other R-functions. Such "
"R-functions could, e.g., be used to extract and manipulate data from log "
"files of software used to conduct experiments (PsychoPy, e-prime, etc.)."

"``jmv`` is available from CRAN (a central repository for publicly "
"available R-packages). To install the library that contains the functions"
" used by jamovi (and in the examples below) open R and type the first "
"line (the >-mark at the begin of the line is the input-mark of R and must"
" not be copied / typed). The package ``haven`` is required if you want to"
" read or write SPSS, SAS or Stata files and can be installed using the "
"second line. If you want to read and write `jamovi "
"<https://www.jamovi.org>`__'s omv-files you can use the package "
"``jmvReadWrite`` which is installed using the third line. Finally, the "
