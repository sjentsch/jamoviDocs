"This should seem suspiciously familiar to anyone who’s worked on R packages "
"before. That’s because jamovi modules *are* R packages, but with that "
"additional ``jamovi/0000.yaml`` file. With that file, this package becomes a"
" dual citizen: it can be built into an R package, and it can be built into a"
" jamovi module."

"If you take a look in the ``0000.yaml`` file, you’ll notice it contains a "
"very similar set of values to the ``DESCRIPTION`` file. However, as we add "
"analyses to the module, they will come to be listed in this file as well. In"
" the early stages of development, there’s not much need to interact with "
"this file, so we’ll return to it later."
