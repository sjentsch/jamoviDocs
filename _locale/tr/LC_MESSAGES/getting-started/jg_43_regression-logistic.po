"You need one continuous predictor variable and one categorical (nominal "
"or ordinal) outcome variable. Make sure that the `measurement levels are "
"set correctly <um_2_first-steps.html#data-variables>`_ so that the "
"predictor variable(s) are marked as |continuous| and the outcome variable"
" is marked as |nominal|."

"Logistic regression can be found by selecting ``Analyses`` → "
"``Regression``. If the outcome variable is nominal (as in the above "
"image), select ``2 Outcomes`` if it has 2 steps / different values, or "
"``N outcomes`` if it has *more* than 2 steps. If the outcome variable is "
"ordinal (e.g. low, medium, high), select ``Ordinal Outcomes``."
