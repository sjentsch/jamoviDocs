"The four patterns of data shown in :numref:`fig-maineffects` are all quite "
"realistic. There are a great many data sets that produce exactly those "
"patterns. However, they are not the whole story and the ANOVA model that we "
"have been talking about up to this point is not sufficient to fully account "
"for a table of group means. Why not? Well, so far we have the ability to "
"talk about the idea that drugs can influence mood, and therapy can influence"
" mood, but no way of talking about the possibility of an **interaction** "
"between the two. An interaction between A and B is said to occur whenever "
"the effect of Factor A is *different*, depending on which level of Factor B "
"we’re talking about. Several examples of an interaction effect with the "
"context of a 2 × 2 ANOVA are shown in :numref:`fig-interactions`. To give a "
"more concrete example, suppose that the operation of Anxifree and Joyzepam "
"is governed by quite different physiological mechanisms. One consequence of "
"this is that while Joyzepam has more or less the same effect on mood "
"regardless of whether one is in therapy, Anxifree is actually much more "
"effective when administered in conjunction with CBT. The ANOVA that we "
"developed in the previous section does not capture this idea. To get some "
"idea of whether an interaction is actually happening here, it helps to plot "
"the various group means. In jamovi this is done via the ANOVA ``Estimated "
"Marginal Means`` option - just move ``drug`` and ``therapy`` across into the"
" ``Marginal Means`` box under ``Term 1``. This should look something like "
":numref:`fig-interaction`. Our main concern relates to the fact that the two"
" lines aren’t parallel. The effect of CBT (difference between solid line and"
" dotted line) when the drug is Joyzepam (right side) appears to be near "
"zero, even smaller than the effect of CBT when a placebo is used (left "
"side). However, when Anxifree is administered, the effect of CBT is larger "
"than the placebo (middle). Is this effect real, or is this just random "
"variation due to chance? Our original ANOVA cannot answer this question, "
"because we make no allowances for the idea that interactions even exist! In "
"this section, we’ll fix this problem."

"The key idea that we’re going to introduce in this section is that of an "
"interaction effect. In the ANOVA model we have looked at so far there are "
"only two *factors* involved in our model (i.e., ``drug`` and ``therapy``). "
"But when we add an interaction we add a new component to the model: the "
"combination of ``drug`` and ``therapy``. Intuitively, the idea behind an "
"interaction effect is fairly simple. It just means that the effect of Factor"
" A is different, depending on which level of Factor B we’re talking about. "
"But what does that actually mean in terms of our data? The plot in :numref"
":`fig-interactions` depicts several different patterns that, although quite "
"different to each other, would all count as an interaction effect. So it’s "
"not entirely straightforward to translate this qualitative idea into "
"something mathematical that a statistician can work with."

"How should we calculate the sum of squares for the interaction terms, SS\\ "

"defined the interaction effect in terms of the extent to which the actual "
"group means differ from what you’d expect by just looking at the marginal "
"means. Of course, all of those formulas refer to population parameters "
"rather than sample statistics, so we don’t actually know what they are. "
"However, we can estimate them by using sample means in place of population "
"means. So for Factor A, a good way to estimate the main effect at level *r* "

":math:`\\bar{Y}_{rc}` and the sample grand mean :math:`\\bar{Y}_{..}`. That "

"There’s a couple of very important things to consider when interpreting the "
"results of factorial ANOVA. First, there’s the same issue that we had with "
"one-way ANOVA, which is that if you obtain a significant main effect of "
"(say) ``drug``, it doesn’t tell you anything about which drugs are different"
" to one another. To find that out, you need to run additional analyses. "
"We’ll talk about some analyses that you can run in Sections `Different ways "
"to specify contrasts <Ch14_ANOVA2_07.html#different-ways-to-specify-"
"contrasts>`__ and `Post-hoc tests <Ch14_ANOVA2_08.html#post-hoc-tests>`__. "

" interaction doesn’t tell you anything about what kind of interaction "
"exists. Again, you’ll need to run additional analyses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch14_ANOVA2_02.rst:269
msgid ""
"Secondly, there’s a very peculiar interpretation issue that arises when you "
"obtain a significant interaction effect but no corresponding main effect. "
"This happens sometimes. For instance, in the crossover interaction shown in "
":numref:`fig-interactions`\\ (top-left panel), this is exactly what you’d "
"find. In this case, neither of the main effects would be significant, but "
"the interaction effect would be. This is a difficult situation to interpret,"
" and people often get a bit confused about it. The general advice that "
"statisticians like to give in this situation is that you shouldn’t pay much "
"attention to the main effects when an interaction is present. The reason "
"they say this is that, although the tests of the main effects are perfectly "
"valid from a mathematical point of view, when there is a significant "
"interaction effect the main effects rarely test interesting hypotheses. "
"Recall from Section `What hypotheses are we testing? <Ch14_ANOVA2_01.html"
"#what-hypotheses-are-we-testing>`__ that the null hypothesis for a main "
"effect is that the *marginal means* are equal to each other, and that a "
"marginal mean is formed by averaging across several different groups. But if"
" you have a significant interaction effect then you *know* that the groups "
"that comprise the marginal mean aren’t homogeneous, so it’s not really "
"obvious why you would even care about those marginal means."

"Here’s what I mean. Again, let’s stick with a clinical example. Suppose that"
" we had a 2 × 2 design comparing two different treatments for phobias (e.g.,"
" systematic desensitisation vs. flooding), and two different anxiety "
"reducing drugs (e.g., Anxifree vs Joyzepam). Now, suppose what we found was "
"that Anxifree had no effect when desensitisation was the treatment, and "
"Joyzepam had no effect when flooding was the treatment. But both were pretty"
