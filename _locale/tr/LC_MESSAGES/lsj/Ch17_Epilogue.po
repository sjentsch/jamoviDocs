"It feels somewhat strange to be writing this chapter, and more than a little"
" inappropriate. An epilogue is what you write when a book is finished, and "
"this book really isn’t finished. There are a lot of things still missing "
"from this book. It doesn’t have an index yet. A lot of references are "
"missing. There are no “do it yourself” exercises. And in general, I feel "
"that there a lot of things that are wrong with the presentation, "
"organisation and content of this book. Given all that, I don’t want to try "
"to write a “proper” epilogue. I haven’t finished writing the substantive "
"content yet, so it doesn’t make sense to try to bring it all together. But "
"this version of the book is going to go online for students to use, and you "
"will may be to purchase a hard copy too, so I want to give it at least a "
"veneer of closure. So let’s give it a go, shall we?"

"First, I’m going to talk a bit about some of the content that I wish I’d had"
" the chance to cram into this version of the book, just so that you can get "
"a sense of what other ideas are out there in the world of statistics. I "
"think this would be important even if this book were getting close to a "
"final product. One thing that students often fail to realise is that their "
"introductory statistics classes are just that, an introduction. If you want "
"to go out into the wider world and do real data analysis, you have to learn "
"a whole lot of new tools that extend the content of your undergraduate "
"lectures in all sorts of different ways. Don’t assume that something can’t "
"be done just because it wasn’t covered in undergrad. Don’t assume that "
"something is the right thing to do just because it *was* covered in an "
"undergrad class. To stop you from falling victim to that trap, I think it’s "
"useful to give a bit of an overview of some of the other ideas out there."
