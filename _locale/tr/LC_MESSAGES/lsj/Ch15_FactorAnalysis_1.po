"**Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)** is a statistical technique for "
"revealing any hidden latent factors that can be inferred from our observed "
"data. This technique calculates to what extent a set of measured variables, "
"for example V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5, can be represented as measures of an "
"underlying latent factor. This latent factor cannot be measured through just"
" one observed variable but instead is manifested in the relationships it "
"causes in a set of observed variables."

"observed variable, *V*\\ :sub:`i`, that is unexplained by the underlying "
"latent factor."

"In Psychology, latent factors represent psychological phenomena or "
"constructs that are difficult to directly observe or measure. For example, "
"personality, or intelligence, or thinking style. In the example in :numref"
":`fig-efa1`, we may have asked people five specific questions about their "
"behaviour or attitudes, and from that we are able to get a picture about a "
"personality construct called, for example, extraversion. A different set of "
"specific questions may give us a picture about an individual’s introversion,"

"In exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we are essentially exploring the "
"correlations between observed variables to uncover any interesting, "
"important underlying (latent) factors that are identified when observed "
"variables co-vary. We can use statistical software to estimate any latent "
"factors and to identify which of our variables have a high loading\\ [#]_ "
"(e.g. loading > 0.5) on each factor, suggesting they are a useful measure, "
"or indicator, of the latent factor. Part of this process includes a step "
"called rotation, which to be honest is a pretty weird idea but luckily we "
"don’t have to worry about understanding it; we just need to know that it is "
"helpful because it makes the pattern of loadings on different factors much "
"clearer. As such, rotation helps with seeing more clearly which variables "
"are linked substantively to each factor. We also need to decide how many "
"factors are reasonable given our data, and helpful in this regard is "
"something called Eigen values. We’ll come back to this in a moment, after we"
" have covered some of the main assumptions of EFA."

"There are a couple of assumptions that need to be checked as part of the "
"analysis. The first assumption is **sphericity**, which essentially checks "
"that the variables in your dataset are correlated with each other to the "
"extent that they can potentially be summarised with a smaller set of "
"factors. Bartlett’s test for sphericity checks whether the observed "
"correlation matrix diverges significantly from a zero (or null) correlation "
"matrix. So, if Bartlett’s test is significant (p < 0.05), this indicates "
"that the observed correlation matrix is significantly divergent from the "
"null, and is therefore suitable for EFA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1.rst:85
msgid ""
"The second assumption is **sampling adequacy** and is checked using the "
"Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA). The KMO index "
"is a measure of the proportion of variance among observed variables that "
"might be common variance. Using partial correlations, it checks for factors "
"that load just two items. We seldom, if ever, want EFA producing a lot of "
"factors loading just two items each. KMO is about sampling adequacy because "
"partial correlations are typically seen with inadequate samples. If the KMO "
"index is high (≈ 1), the EFA is efficient whereas if KMO is low (≈ 0), the "
"EFA is not relevant. KMO values smaller than 0.5 indicates that EFA is not "
"suitable and a KMO value of 0.6 should be present before EFA is considered "
"suitable. Values between 0.5 and 0.7 are considered adequate, values between"
" 0.7 and 0.9 are good and values between 0.9 and 1.0 are excellent."

"If the EFA has provided a good solution (i.e. factor model), then we need to"
" decide what to do with our shiny new factors. Researchers often use EFA "
"during psychometric scale development. They will develop a pool of "
"questionnaire items that they think relate to one or more psychological "
"constructs, use EFA to see which items “go together” as latent factors, and "
"then they will assess whether some items should be removed because they "
"don’t usefully or distinctly measure one of the latent factors."

"In line with this approach, another consequence of EFA is to combine the "
"variables that load onto distinct factors into a factor score, sometimes "
"known as a scale score. There are two options for combining variables into a"
" scale score:"

"In the first option each item’s contribution to the combined score depends "
"on how strongly it relates to the factor. In the second option we typically "
"just average across all the items that contribute substantively to a factor "
"to create the combined scale score variable. Which to choose is a matter of "
"preference, though a disadvantage with the first option is that loadings can"
" vary quite a bit from sample to sample, and in behavioural and health "
"sciences we are often interested in developing and using composite "
"questionnaire scale scores across different studies and different samples. "
"In which case it is reasonable to use a composite measure that is based on "
"the substantive items contributing equally rather than weighting by sample "
"specific loadings from a different sample. In any case, understanding a "
"combined variable measure as an average of items is simpler and more "
"intuitive than using a sample specific optimally-weighted combination."

"Final factor loadings should be reported in the results, in a table. This "
"table should also report the uniqueness (or communality) for each variable "
"(in the final column). Factor loadings should be reported with descriptive "
"labels in addition to item numbers. Correlations between the factors should "
"also be included, either at the bottom of this table, in a separate table."

"Oblique rotations provide two factor matrices, one called a structure matrix"
" and one called a pattern matrix. In jamovi just the pattern matrix is shown"
" in the results as this is typically the most useful for interpretation, "
"though some experts suggest that both can be helpful. In a structure matrix "
"coefficients show the relationship between the variable and the factors "
"whilst ignoring the relationship of that factor with all the other factors "
"(i.e. a zero-order correlation). Pattern matrix coefficients show the unique"
" contribution of a factor to a variable whilst controlling for the effects "
"of other factors on that variable (akin to standardized partial regression "
"coefficient). Under orthogonal rotation, structure and pattern coefficients "
"are the same."
