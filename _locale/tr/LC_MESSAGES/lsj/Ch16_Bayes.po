"The ideas I’ve presented to you in this book describe inferential statistics"
" from the frequentist perspective. I’m not alone in doing this. In fact, "
"almost every textbook given to undergraduate psychology students presents "
"the opinions of the frequentist statistician as *the* theory of inferential "
"statistics, the one true way to do things. I have taught this way for "
"practical reasons. The frequentist view of statistics dominated the academic"
" field of statistics for most of the 20th century, and this dominance is "
"even more extreme among applied scientists. It was and is current practice "
"among psychologists to use frequentist methods. Because frequentist methods "
"are ubiquitous in scientific papers, every student of statistics needs to "
"understand those methods, otherwise they will be unable to make sense of "
"what those papers are saying! Unfortunately, in my opinion at least, the "
"current practice in psychology is often misguided and the reliance on "
"frequentist methods is partly to blame. In this chapter I explain why I "
"think this and provide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, an approach "
"that I think is generally superior to the orthodox approach."

"This chapter comes in two parts: In Sections `Probabilistic reasoning by "
"rational agents <Ch16_Bayes_1.html#probabilistic-reasoning-by-rational-"
"agents>`__) through `Why be a Bayesian? <Ch16_Bayes_3.html#why-"
"be-a-bayesian>`__) I talk about what Bayesian statistics are all about, "
"covering the basic mathematical rules for how it works as well as an "
"explanation for why I think the Bayesian approach is so useful. Afterwards, "
"I provide a brief overview of how you can do `Bayesian versions of t-tests "
