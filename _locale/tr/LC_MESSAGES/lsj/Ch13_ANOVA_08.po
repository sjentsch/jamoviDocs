"The Friedman test is a non-parametric version of a repeated measures ANOVA "
"and can be used instead of the Kruskall-Wallis test when testing for "
"differences between three or more groups where the same participants are in "
"each group, or each participant is closely matched with participants in "
"other conditions. If the dependent variable is ordinal, or if the assumption"
" of normality is not met, then the Friedman test can be used."

"As with the Kruskall-Wallis test, the underlying mathematics is complicated,"
" and won’t be presented here. For the purpose of this book, it is sufficient"
" to note that jamovi calculates the tie-corrected version of the Friedman "
"test, and in :numref:`fig-RManova6` there is an example using the Broca’s "
"Aphasia data we have already looked at."

msgid ""
"It’s pretty straightforward to run a Friedman test in jamovi. Just select "
"``Analyses`` → ``ANOVA`` → ``Repeated Measures ANOVA (Non-parametric)``, as "
"in :numref:`fig-RManova6`. Then highlight and transfer the names of the "
"repeated measures variables you wish to compare (``Speech``, ``Conceptual``,"
" ``Syntax``) into the ``Measures:`` text box. To produce descriptive "
"statistics (means and medians) for the three repeated measures variables, "
"click on the ``Descriptives`` button."

msgid ""
"The jamovi results show descriptive statistics, χ²-value, degrees of "
"freedom, and the *p*-value (:numref:`fig-RManova6`). Since the *p*-value is "
"less than the level conventionally used to determine significance (*p* < "
"0.05), we can conclude that Broca’s Aphasics perform reasonably well on "
"speech production (median = 7.5) and language comprehension (median = 6.5) "
"tasks. However, their performance was considerably worse on the syntax task "
"(median = 4.5), with a significant difference in post-hoc tests between "
"Speech and Syntax task performance."
