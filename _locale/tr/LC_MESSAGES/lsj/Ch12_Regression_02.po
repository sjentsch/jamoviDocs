"**Scatterplots** are a simple but effective tool for visualising the "
"relationship between *two* variables, like we saw with the figures in the "
"section on correlation (Section `Correlations "
"<Ch12_Regression_01.html#correlations>`__). It’s this latter application "
"that we usually have in mind when we use the term “scatterplot”. In this "
"kind of plot each observation corresponds to one dot. The horizontal "
"location of the dot plots the value of the observation on one variable, and "
"the vertical location displays its value on the other variable. In many "
"situations you don’t really have a clear opinions about what the *causal* "
"relationship is (e.g., does A cause B, or does B cause A, or does some other"
" variable C control both A and B). If that’s the case, it doesn’t really "
"matter which variable you plot on the x-axis and which one you plot on the "
"y-axis. However, in many situations you do have a pretty strong idea which "
"variable you think is most likely to be causal, or at least you have some "
"suspicions in that direction. If so, then it’s conventional to plot the "
"cause variable on the x-axis, and the effect variable on the y-axis. With "
"that in mind, let’s look at how to draw scatterplots in jamovi, using the "
"same ``parenthood`` data set that I used when introducing correlations."

"Suppose my goal is to draw a scatterplot displaying the relationship between"
" the amount of sleep that I get (``dan.sleep``) and how grumpy I am the next"
" day (``dan.grump``). There are two different ways in which we can use "
"jamovi to get the plot that we’re after. The first way is to use the "
"``Plot`` option under the ``Regression`` → ``Correlation Matrix`` button, "
"giving us the output shown in :numref:`fig-scatterplot1`. Note that jamovi "
"draws a line through the points, we’ll come onto this a bit later in Section"
" `What is a linear regression model? <Ch12_Regression_03.html#what-is-a"
"-linear-regression-model>`__. Plotting a scatterplot in this way also allow "
"you to specify ``Densities for variables`` and this option adds a density "
"curve showing how the data in each variable is distributed."

"The second way do to it is to use one of the jamovi add-on modules. This "
"module is called ``scatr`` and you can install it by clicking on the large "
"``+`` icon in the top right of the jamovi screen, opening the jamovi "
"library, scrolling down until you find ``scatr`` and clicking ``Install``. "
"When you have done this, you will find a new ``Scatterplot`` command "
"available under the ``Exploration`` button. This plot is a bit different "
"than the first way, see :numref:`fig-scatterplot2`, but the important "
"information is the same."

"Often you will want to look at the relationships between several variables "
"at once, using a **scatterplot matrix** (in jamovi via the ``Correlation "
"Matrix`` - ``Plot`` command). Just add another variable, for example "
"``baby.sleep`` to the list of variables to be correlated, and jamovi will "
"create a scatterplot matrix for you, just like the one in :numref:`fig-"
"scatterplot3`."
