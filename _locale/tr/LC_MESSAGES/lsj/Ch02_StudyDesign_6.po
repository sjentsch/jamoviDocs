"This chapter isn’t really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of "
"psychological research methods. It would require another volume just as long"
" as this one to do justice to the topic. However, in real life statistics "
"and study design are so tightly intertwined that it’s very handy to discuss "
"some of the key topics. In this chapter, I’ve briefly discussed the "
"following topics:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:13
msgid ""
"`*Introduction to psychological measurement* <Ch02_StudyDesign_1.html"
"#introduction-to-psychological-measurement>`__: What does it mean to "
"operationalise a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables "
"and take measurements?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:18
msgid ""
"`*Scales of measurement and types of variables* <Ch02_StudyDesign_2.html"
"#scales-of-measurement>`__: Remember that there are *two* different "
"distinctions here. There’s the difference between discrete and continuous "
"data, and there’s the difference between the four different scale types "
"(nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:24
msgid ""
"`*Reliability of a measurement* <Ch02_StudyDesign_3.html#assessing-the-"
"reliability-of-a-measurement>`__: If I measure the “same” thing twice, "
"should I expect to see the same result? Only if my measure is reliable. But "
"what does it mean to talk about doing the “same” thing? Well, that’s why we "
"have different types of reliability. Make sure you remember what they are."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:31
msgid ""
"`*Terminology: predictors and outcomes* <Ch02_StudyDesign_3.html#the-role-"
"of-variables-predictors-and-outcomes>`__: What roles do variables play in an"
" analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and outcomes? "
"Dependent and independent variables? etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:36
msgid ""
"`*Experimental and non-experimental research designs* "
"<Ch02_StudyDesign_4.html#experimental-and-non-experimental-research>`__: "
"What makes an experiment an experiment? Is it a nice white lab coat, or does"
" it have something to do with researcher control over variables?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:41
msgid ""
"`*Validity and its threats* <Ch02_StudyDesign_5.html#assessing-the-validity-"
"of-a-study>`__: Does your study measure what you want it to? How might "
"things go wrong? And is it my imagination, or was that a very long list of "
"possible ways in which things can go wrong?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch02_StudyDesign_6.rst:47
msgid ""
"All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of "
"research methodology. I built this chapter from the classic little book by "
"`Campbell and Stanley (1963) <References.html#campbell-1963>`__, but there "
"are of course a large number of textbooks out there on research design. "
"Spend a few minutes with your favourite search engine and you’ll find "
"dozens."
