"Up to this point in the book we’ve discussed some of the key ideas in "
"experimental design, and we’ve talked a little about how you can summarise a"
" data set. To a lot of people this is all there is to statistics: collecting"
" all the numbers, calculating averages, drawing pictures, and putting them "
"all in a report somewhere. Kind of like stamp collecting but with numbers. "
"However, statistics covers much more than that. In fact, descriptive "
"statistics is one of the smallest parts of statistics and one of the least "
"powerful. The bigger and more useful part of statistics is that it provides "
"information that lets you make inferences about data."

"Once you start thinking about statistics in these terms, that statistics is "
"there to help us draw inferences from data, you start seeing examples of it "
"everywhere. For instance, here’s a tiny extract from a newspaper article in "
"the Sydney Morning Herald (30 Oct 2010):"

"“I have a tough job,” the Premier said in response to a poll which found her"
" government is now the most unpopular Labor administration in polling "
"history, with a primary vote of just 23 per cent."

"This kind of remark is entirely unremarkable in the papers or in everyday "
"life, but let’s have a think about what it entails. A polling company has "
"conducted a survey, usually a pretty big one because they can afford it. I’m"
" too lazy to track down the original survey so let’s just imagine that they "
"called 1000 New South Wales (NSW) voters at random, and 230 (23%) of those "
"claimed that they intended to vote for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). For"
" the 2010 Federal election the Australian Electoral Commission reported "
"4,610,795 enrolled voters in NSW, so the opinions of the remaining 4,609,795"
" voters (about 99.98% of voters) remain unknown to us. Even assuming that "
"no-one lied to the polling company the only thing we can say with 100% "
"confidence is that the true ALP primary vote is somewhere between "
"230/4610795 (about \\0.005%) and 4610025/4610795 (about 99.83%). So, on what"
" basis is it legitimate for the polling company, the newspaper, and the "
"readership to conclude that the ALP primary vote is only about 23%?"

"The answer to the question is pretty obvious. If I call 1000 people at "
"random, and 230 of them say they intend to vote for the ALP, then it seems "
"very unlikely that these are the *only* 230 people out of the entire voting "
"public who actually intend to vote ALP. In other words, we assume that the "
"data collected by the polling company is pretty representative of the "
"population at large. But how representative? Would we be surprised to "
"discover that the true ALP primary vote is actually 24%? 29%? 37%? At this "
"point everyday intuition starts to break down a bit. No-one would be "
"surprised by 24%, and everybody would be surprised by 37%, but it’s a bit "
"hard to say whether 29% is plausible. We need some more powerful tools than "
"just looking at the numbers and guessing."

"**Inferential statistics** provides the tools that we need to answer these "
"sorts of questions, and since these kinds of questions lie at the heart of "
"the scientific enterprise, they take up the lions share of every "
"introductory course on statistics and research methods. However, the theory "
"of statistical inference is built on top of **probability theory**. And it "
"is to probability theory that we must now turn. This discussion of "
"probability theory is basically background detail. There’s not a lot of "
"statistics per se in this chapter, and you don’t need to understand this "
"material in as much depth as the other chapters in this part of the book. "
"Nevertheless, because probability theory does underpin so much of "
"statistics, it’s worth covering some of the basics."
