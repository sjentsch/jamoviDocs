"Time to switch to a different topic. Rather than pre-planned comparisons "
"that you have tested using contrasts, let’s suppose you’ve done your ANOVA "
"and it turns out that you obtained some significant effects. Because of the "
"fact that the *F*-tests are “omnibus” tests that only really test the null "
"hypothesis that there are no differences among groups, obtaining a "
"significant effect doesn’t tell you which groups are different to which "
"other ones. We discussed this issue back in Chapter `Comparing several means"
" (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__ "
", and in that chapter our solution was to run *t*-tests for all possible "
"pairs of groups, making corrections for multiple comparisons (e.g., "
"Bonferroni, Holm) to control the Type I error rate across all comparisons. "
"The methods that we used back there have the advantage of being relatively "
"simple and being the kind of tools that you can use in a lot of different "
"situations where you’re testing multiple hypotheses, but they’re not "
"necessarily the best choices if you’re interested in doing efficient post-"
"hoc testing in an ANOVA context. There are actually quite a lot of different"
" methods for performing multiple comparisons in the statistics literature "
"(`Hsu, 1996 <References.html#hsu-1996>`__\\ ), and it would be beyond the "
"scope of an introductory text like this one to discuss all of them in any "
"detail."

"That being said, there’s one tool that I do want to draw your attention to, "
"namely Tukey’s “Honestly Significant Difference”, or **Tukey’s HSD** for "
"short. For once, I’ll spare you the formulas and just stick to the "
"qualitative ideas. The basic idea in Tukey’s HSD is to examine all relevant "
"pairwise comparisons between groups, and it’s only really appropriate to use"
" Tukey’s HSD if it is *pairwise* differences that you’re interested in.\\ "
"[#]_ For instance, earlier we conducted a factorial ANOVA using the "
"``clinicaltrial.csv`` data set, and where we specified a main effect for "
"drug and a main effect of therapy we would be interested in the following "
"four comparisons:"

"For any one of these comparisons, we’re interested in the true difference "
"between (population) group means. Tukey’s HSD constructs **simultaneous "
"confidence intervals** for all four of these comparisons. What we mean by "
"95% “simultaneous” confidence interval is that, if we were to repeat this "
"study many times, then in 95% of the study results the confidence intervals "
"would contain the relevant true value. Moreover, we can use these confidence"
" intervals to calculate an adjusted *p* value for any specific comparison."

"The ``TukeyHSD`` function in jamovi is pretty easy to use. You simply "
"specify the ANOVA model term that you want to run the post-hoc tests for. "
"For example, if we were looking to run post-hoc tests for the main effects "
"but not the interaction, we would open up the ‘Post Hoc Tests’ option in the"
" ANOVA analysis screen, move the ``drug`` and ``therapy`` variables across "
"to the box on the right, and then select the ‘Tukey’ checkbox in the list of"
" possible post-hoc corrections that could be applied. This, along with the "
"corresponding results table, is shown in :numref:`fig-factorialanova13`."

"The output shown in the ‘Post Hoc Tests’ results table is (I hope) pretty "
"straightforward. The first comparison, for example, is the Anxifree versus "
"placebo difference, and the first part of the output indicates that the "
"observed difference in group means is 0.27. The next number is the standard "
"error for the difference, from which we could calculate the 95% confidence "
"interval if we wanted, though jamovi does not currently provide this option."
" Then there is a column with the degrees of freedom, a column with the "
"*t*-value, and finally a column with the *p*-value. For the first comparison"
" the adjusted *p*-value is 0.21. In contrast, if you look at the next line, "
"we see that the observed difference between joyzepam and the placebo is "
"1.03, and this result is significant (*p* < 0.001)."

"So far, so good. What about the situation where your model includes "
"interaction terms? For instance, the default option in jamovi is to allow "
"for the possibility that there is an interaction between drug and therapy. "
"If that’s the case, the number of pairwise comparisons that we need to "
"consider starts to increase. As before, we need to consider the three "
"comparisons that are relevant to the main effect of ``drug`` and the one "
"comparison that is relevant to the main effect of ``therapy``. But, if we "
"want to consider the possibility of a significant interaction (and try to "
"find the group differences that underpin that significant interaction), we "
"need to include comparisons such as the following:"

"If, for instance, you actually find yourself interested to know if Group A "
