"Another form of graph that you often want to plot is the **bar graph**. "
"Let’s use the ``afl.finalists`` data set with the ``afl.finalists`` variable"
" that I introduced in `Mode <Ch04_Descriptives_1.html#mode>`__. What I want "
"to do is draw a bar graph that displays the number of finals that each team "
"has played in over the time spanned by the ``afl.finalists`` data set. There"
" are lots of teams, but I am particularly interested in just four: Brisbane,"
" Carlton, Fremantle and Richmond. So the first step is to set up a filter so"
" just those four teams are included in the bar graph. This is "
"straightforward in jamovi and you can do it by using the ``Filters`` "
"function that we used previously. Open up the ``Filters`` screen and type in"
" the following:"

"When you have done this you will see, in the ``Data`` view, that jamovi has "
"filtered out all values apart from those we have specified. Next, open up "
"the ``Exploration`` → ``Descriptives`` window and click on the ``Bar plot`` "
"check box (remember to move the ``afl.finalists`` variable across into the "
"``Variables`` box so that jamovi knows which variable to use). You should "
"then get a bar graph, something like that shown in :numref:`fig-bar1`."

"Hold on, you might be thinking. What’s the good of being able to draw pretty"
" pictures in jamovi if I can’t save them and send them to friends to brag "
"about how awesome my data is? How do I save the picture? Simples. Just right"
" click on the plot image and save it to a file, either as ``eps`, ``svg`` or"
" ``pdf``. These formats all produce nice images that you can the send to "
"your friends, or include in your assignments or papers."
