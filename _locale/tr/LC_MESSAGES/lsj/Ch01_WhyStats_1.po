"To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant part of"
" a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very "
"rarely the *favourite* part of one’s psychological education. After all, if "
"you really loved the idea of doing statistics, you’d probably be enrolled in"
" a statistics class right now, not a psychology class. So, not surprisingly,"
" there’s a pretty large proportion of the student base that isn’t happy "
"about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it. In view of "
"this, I thought that the right place to start might be to answer some of the"
" more common questions that people have about stats."

"A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. "
"What is it? What’s it there for? And why are scientists so bloody obsessed "
"with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it. So let’s "
"start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be bizarrely fixated"
" on running statistical tests on everything. In fact, we use statistics so "
"often that we sometimes forget to explain to people why we do. It’s a kind "
"of article of faith among scientists – and especially social scientists – "
"that your findings can’t be trusted until you’ve done some stats. "
"Undergraduate students might be forgiven for thinking that we’re all "
"completely mad, because no-one takes the time to answer one very simple "
"question:"

"It’s a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. There’s a "
"lot of good answers to it,\\ [#]_ but for my money, the best answer is a "
"really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we’re "
"human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that "
"humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using "
"“common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on"
" verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with"
" the right answer. Most scientists don’t think this approach is likely to "
"work."

"In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological "
"question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems "
"like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to "
"think that this “common sense” approach is very trustworthy? Verbal "
"arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have biases "
"– some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily because "
"they’re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, but hard to "
"explain in words). The instincts of our “gut” aren’t designed to solve "
"scientific problems, they’re designed to handle day to day inferences – and "
"given that biological evolution is slower than cultural change, we should "
"say that they’re designed to solve the day to day problems for a *different "
"world* than the one we live in. Most fundamentally, reasoning sensibly "
"requires people to engage in “induction”, making wise guesses and going "
"beyond the immediate evidence of the senses to make generalisations about "
"the world. If you think that you can do that without being influenced by "
"various distractors, well, I have a bridge in London I’d like to sell you. "
"Heck, as the next section shows, we can’t even solve “deductive” problems "
"(ones where no guessing is required) without being influenced by our pre-"
"existing biases."
