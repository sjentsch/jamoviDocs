"`The method of planned comparisons <Ch14_ANOVA2_09.html#the-method-of-"
"planned-comparisons>`__ Following on from the previous sections on contrasts"
" and post-hoc tests in ANOVA, I think the method of planned comparisons is "
"important enough to deserve a quick discussion. In our discussions of "
"multiple comparisons, in the previous section and back in Chapter `Comparing"
" several means (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-"
"way-anova>`__, I’ve been assuming that the tests you want to run are "
"genuinely post-hoc. For instance, in our drugs example above, maybe you "
"thought that the drugs would all have different effects on mood (i.e., you "
"hypothesised a main effect of drug), but you didn’t have any specific "
"hypothesis about how they would be different, nor did you have any real idea"
" about *which* pairwise comparisons would be worth looking at. If that is "
"the case, then you really have to resort to something like Tukey’s HSD to do"
" your pairwise comparisons."

msgid ""
"The situation is rather different, however, if you genuinely did have real, "
"specific hypotheses about which comparisons are of interest, and you *never*"
" *ever* have any intention to look at any other comparisons besides the ones"
" that you specified ahead of time. When this is true, and if you honestly "
"and rigorously stick to your noble intentions to not run any other "
"comparisons (even when the data look like they’re showing you deliciously "
"significant effects for stuff you didn’t have a hypothesis test for), then "
"it doesn’t really make a lot of sense to run something like Tukey’s HSD, "
"because it makes corrections for a whole bunch of comparisons that you never"
" cared about and never had any intention of looking at. Under those "
"circumstances, you can safely run a (limited) number of hypothesis tests "
"without making an adjustment for multiple testing. This situation is known "
"as the **method of planned comparisons**, and it is sometimes used in "
"clinical trials. However, further consideration is out of scope for this "
"introductory book, but at least you know that this method exists!"
