"The effect size calculation for a factorial ANOVA is pretty similar to those"
" used in One-Way ANOVA (see Section `Effect size <Ch13_ANOVA_04.html#effect-"
"size>`__). Specifically, we can use η² (eta-squared) as a simple way to "
"measure how big the overall effect is for any particular term. As before, η²"
" is defined by dividing the sum of squares associated with that term by the "
"total sum of squares. For instance, to determine the size of the main effect"
" of Factor A, we would use the following formula:"

"As before, this can be interpreted in much the same way as *R²* in "
"regression.\\ [#]_ It tells you the proportion of variance in the outcome "
"variable that can be accounted for by the main effect of Factor A. It is "
"therefore a number that ranges from 0 (no effect at all) to 1 (accounts for "
"*all* of the variability in the outcome). Moreover, the sum of all the η² "
"values, taken across all the terms in the model, will sum to the the total "
"*R²* for the ANOVA model. If, for instance, the ANOVA model fits perfectly "
"(i.e., there is no within-groups variability at all!), the η² values will "
"sum to 1. Of course, that rarely if ever happens in real life."

"However, when doing a factorial ANOVA, there is a second measure of effect "
"size that people like to report, known as partial η². The idea behind "
"partial η² (which is sometimes denoted :sub:`p`\\ η² or \\η²\\ :sub:`p`) is "
"that, when measuring the effect size for a particular term (say, the main "
"effect of Factor A), you want to deliberately ignore the other effects in "
"the model (e.g., the main effect of Factor B). That is, you would pretend "
"that the effect of all these other terms is zero, and then calculate what "
"the η²-value would have been. This is actually pretty easy to calculate. All"
" you have to do is remove the sum of squares associated with the other terms"
" from the denominator. In other words, if you want the partial η² for the "
"main effect of Factor A, the denominator is just the sum of the SS values "
"for Factor A and the residuals"

"This will always give you a larger number than η², which the cynic in me "
"suspects accounts for the popularity of partial η². And once again you get a"
" number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no effect. However, it’s "
"slightly trickier to interpret what a large partial η² value means. In "
"particular, you can’t actually compare the partial η² values across terms! "
"Suppose, for instance, there is no within-groups variability at all: if so, "
"SS\\ :sub:`R` = 0. What that means is that *every* term has a partial η² "
"value of 1. But that doesn’t mean that all terms in your model are equally "
"important, or indeed that they are equally large. All it mean is that all "
"terms in your model have effect sizes that are large *relative to the "
"residual variation*. It is not comparable across terms."

"To see what I mean by this, it’s useful to see a concrete example. First, "
"let’s have a look at the effect sizes for the original ANOVA without the "

"Looking at the η² values first, we see that ``drug`` accounts for 71% of the"
" variance (i.e. η² = 0.71) in ``mood.gain``, whereas ``therapy`` only "
"accounts for 10%. This leaves a total of 19% of the variation unaccounted "
"for (i.e., the residuals constitute 19% of the variation in the outcome). "
"Overall, this implies that we have a very large effect\\ [#]_ of ``drug`` "
"and a modest effect of ``therapy``."

"Now let’s look at the partial η² values, shown in :numref:`fig-"
"factorialanova3`. Because the effect of ``therapy`` isn’t all that large, "
"controlling for it doesn’t make much of a difference, so the partial η² for "
"``drug`` doesn’t increase very much, and we obtain a value of :sub:`p`\\ η² "
"= 0.79). In contrast, because the effect of ``drug`` was very large, "
"controlling for it makes a big difference, and so when we calculate the "
"partial η² for ``therapy`` you can see that it rises to :sub:`p`\\ η² = "
"0.34. The question that we have to ask ourselves is, what do these partial "
"η² values actually *mean*? The way I generally interpret the partial η² for "
"the main effect of Factor A is to interpret it as a statement about a "
"hypothetical experiment in which *only* Factor A was being varied. So, even "
"though in *this* experiment we varied both A and B, we can easily imagine an"
" experiment in which only Factor A was varied, and the partial η² statistic "
"tells you how much of the variance in the outcome variable you would expect "
"to see accounted for in that experiment. However, it should be noted that "
"this interpretation, like many things associated with main effects, doesn’t "
"make a lot of sense when there is a large and significant interaction "
"effect."

"In many situations you will find yourself wanting to report estimates of all"
" the group means based on the results of your ANOVA, as well as confidence "
"intervals associated with them. You can use the ``Estimated Marginal Means``"
" option in the jamovi ANOVA analysis to do this, as in :numref:`fig-"
"margmean1`. If the ANOVA that you have run is a **saturated model** (i.e., "
"contains all possible main effects and all possible interaction effects) "
"then the estimates of the group means are actually identical to the sample "
"means, though the confidence intervals will use a pooled estimate of the "
"standard errors rather than use a separate one for each group."

"In the output we see that the estimated mean mood gain for the placebo group"
" with no therapy was 0.300, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.006 to "
"0.594. Note that these are not the same confidence intervals that you would "
"get if you calculated them separately for each group, because of the fact "
"that the ANOVA model assumes homogeneity of variance and therefore uses a "
"pooled estimate of the standard deviation."

"When the model doesn’t contain the interaction term, then the estimated "
"group means will be different from the sample means. Instead of reporting "
"the sample mean, jamovi will calculate the value of the group means that "
"would be expected on the basis of the marginal means (i.e., assuming no "
"interaction). Using the notation we developed earlier, the estimate reported"
" for µ\\ :sub:`rc`, the mean for level *r* on the (row) Factor A and level "
"*c* on the (column) Factor B would be µ\\ :sub:`..` + α\\ :sub:`r` + β\\ "
":sub:`c`\\. If there are genuinely no interactions between the two factors, "
"this is actually a better estimate of the population mean than the raw "
"sample mean would be. Removing the interaction term from the model, via the "
"‘Model’ options in the jamovi ANOVA analysis, provides the marginal means "
"for the analysis shown in :numref:`fig-margmean2`."
