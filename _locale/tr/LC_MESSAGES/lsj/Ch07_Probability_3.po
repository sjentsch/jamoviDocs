"Ideological arguments between Bayesians and frequentists notwithstanding, it"
" turns out that people mostly agree on the rules that probabilities should "
"obey. There are lots of different ways of arriving at these rules. The most "
"commonly used approach is based on the work of Andrey Kolmogorov, one of the"
" great Soviet mathematicians of the 20th century. I won’t go into a lot of "
"detail, but I’ll try to give you a bit of a sense of how it works. And in "
"order to do so I’m going to have to talk about my trousers."

"One of the disturbing truths about my life is that I only own 5 pairs of "
"trousers. Three pairs of jeans, the bottom half of a suit, and a pair of "
"tracksuit pants. Even sadder, I’ve given them names: I call them *X*\\ "
":sub:`1`\\ , *X*\\ :sub:`2`\\ , *X*\\ :sub:`3`\\ , *X*\\ :sub:`4`  and *X*\\"
" :sub:`5`\\ . I really have, that’s why they call me Mister Imaginative. "
"Now, on any given day, I pick out exactly one of pair of trousers to wear. "
"Not even I’m so stupid as to try to wear two pairs of trousers, and thanks "
"to years of training I never go outside without wearing trousers anymore. If"
" I were to describe this situation using the language of probability theory,"
" I would refer to each pair of trousers (i.e., each *X*) as an **elementary "
"event**. The key characteristic of elementary events is that every time we "
"make an observation (e.g., every time I put on a pair of trousers) then the "
"outcome will be one and only one of these events. Like I said, these days I "
"always wear exactly one pair of trousers so my trousers satisfy this "
"constraint. Similarly, the set of all possible events is called a **sample "
"space**. Granted, some people would call it a “wardrobe”, but that’s because"
" they’re refusing to think about my trousers in probabilistic terms. Sad."

"Okay, now that we have a sample space (a wardrobe), which is built from lots"
" of possible elementary events (trousers), what we want to do is assign a "
"**probability** of one of these elementary events. For an event *X*, the "
"probability of that event *P*\\ (X) is a number that lies between 0 and 1. "
"The bigger the value of *P*\\ (X), the more likely the event is to occur. "
"So, for example, if *P*\\ (X) = 0 it means the event *X* is impossible "
"(i.e., I never wear those trousers). On the other hand, if *P*\\ (X) = 1 it "
"means that event *X* is certain to occur (i.e., I always wear those "
"trousers). For probability values in the middle it means that I sometimes "
"wear those trousers. For instance, if *P*\\ (X) = 0.5 it means that I wear "
"those trousers half of the time."

"At this point, we’re almost done. The last thing we need to recognise is "
"that “something always happens”. Every time I put on trousers, I really do "
"end up wearing trousers (crazy, right?). What this somewhat trite statement "
"means, in probabilistic terms, is that the probabilities of the elementary "
"events need to add up to 1. This is known as the **law of total "
"probability**, not that any of us really care. More importantly, if these "
"requirements are satisfied then what we have is a **probability "
"distribution**. For example, this is an example of a probability "
"distribution:"

"Each of the events has a probability that lies between 0 and 1, and if we "

"Visual depiction of the “trousers” probability distribution. There are five "

"The only other thing that I need to point out is that probability theory "
"allows you to talk about **non elementary events** as well as elementary "
"ones. The easiest way to illustrate the concept is with an example. In the "
"trousers example it’s perfectly legitimate to refer to the probability that "
"I wear jeans. In this scenario, the “Dan wears jeans” event is said to have "
"happened as long as the elementary event that actually did occur is one of "
"the appropriate ones. In this case “blue jeans”, “black jeans” or “grey "
"jeans”. In mathematical terms we defined the “jeans” event *E* to correspond"
" to the set of elementary events (X\\ :sub:`1`\\ , X\\ :sub:`2`\\ , X\\ "
":sub:`3`\\ )`. If any of these elementary events occurs then *E* is also "
"said to have occurred. Having decided to write down the definition of the "
"*E* this way, it’s pretty straightforward to state what the probability "
"*P*\\ (E) is: we just add everything up. In this particular case"

"At this point you might be thinking that this is all terribly obvious and "
"simple and you’d be right. All we’ve really done is wrap some basic "
"mathematics around a few common sense intuitions. However, from these simple"
" beginnings it’s possible to construct some extremely powerful mathematical "
"tools. I’m definitely not going to go into the details in this book, but "
"what I will do is list, in :numref:`tab-probrules`, some of the other rules "
"that probabilities satisfy. These rules can be derived from the simple "
"assumptions that I’ve outlined above, but since we don’t actually use these "
"rules for anything in this book I won’t do so here."
