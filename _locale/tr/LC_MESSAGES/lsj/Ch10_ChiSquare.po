"Now that we’ve covered the basic theory behind hypothesis testing it’s time "
"to start looking at specific tests that are commonly used in psychology. So "
"where should we start? Not every textbook agrees on where to start, but I’m "
"going to start with “χ² tests” (this chapter, pronounced “chi-square” [#]_) "
"and “*t*-tests” (Chapter `Comparing two means <Ch11_tTest.html#comparing-"
"two-means>`__). Both of these tools are very frequently used in scientific "
"practice, and whilst they’re not as powerful as “regression” (see Chapter "
"`Correlation and linear regression <Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-"
"linear-regression>`__) and “Analysis of Variance” (Chapter `Comparing "
"several means (one-way ANOVA) <Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-"
"way-anova>`__) they’re much easier to understand."

"The term “categorical data” is just another name for “nominal scale data”. "
"It’s nothing that we haven’t already discussed, it’s just that in the "
"context of data analysis people tend to use the term “categorical data” "
"rather than “nominal scale data”. I don’t know why. In any case, "
"**categorical data analysis** refers to a collection of tools that you can "
"use when your data are nominal scale. However, there are a lot of different "
"tools that can be used for categorical data analysis, and this chapter "
"covers only a few of the more common ones."
