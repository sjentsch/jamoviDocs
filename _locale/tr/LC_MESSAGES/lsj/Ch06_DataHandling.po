"This is a somewhat strange chapter, even by my standards. My goal in this "
"chapter is to talk a bit more honestly about the realities of working with "
"data than you’ll see anywhere else in the book. The problem with real world "
"data sets is that they are *messy*. Very often the data file that you start "
"out with doesn’t have the variables stored in the right format for the "
"analysis you want to do. Sometimes there might be a lot of missing values in"
" your data set. Sometimes you only want to analyse a subset of the data. Et "
"cetera. In other words, there’s a lot of **data manipulation** that you need"
" to do just to get the variables in your data set into the format that you "
"need it. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a basic introduction to "
"these pragmatic topics. Although the chapter is motivated by the kinds of "
"practical issues that arise when manipulating real data, I’ll stick with the"
" practice that I’ve adopted through most of the book and rely on very small,"
" toy data sets that illustrate the underlying issue. Because this chapter is"
" essentially a collection of techniques and doesn’t tell a single coherent "
"story, it may be useful to start with a list of topics:"

"As you can see, the list of topics that the chapter covers is pretty broad, "
"and there’s a *lot* of content there. Even though this is one of the longest"
" and hardest chapters in the book, I’m really only scratching the surface of"
" several fairly different and important topics. My advice, as usual, is to "
"read through the chapter once and try to follow as much of it as you can. "
"Don’t worry too much if you can’t grasp it all at once, especially the later"
" sections. The rest of the book is only lightly reliant on this chapter so "
"you can get away with just understanding the basics. However, what you’ll "
"probably find is that later on you’ll need to flick back to this chapter in "
"order to understand some of the concepts that I refer to here."
