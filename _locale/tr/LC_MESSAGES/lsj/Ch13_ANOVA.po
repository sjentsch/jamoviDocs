"This chapter introduces one of the most widely used tools in psychological "
"statistics, known as “the analysis of variance”, but usually referred to as "
"ANOVA. The basic technique was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early "
"20th century and it is to him that we owe the rather unfortunate "
"terminology. The term ANOVA is a little misleading, in two respects. "
"Firstly, although the name of the technique refers to variances, ANOVA is "
"concerned with investigating differences in means. Secondly, there are "
"several different things out there that are all referred to as ANOVAs, some "
"of which have only a very tenuous connection to one another. Later on in the"
" book we’ll encounter a range of different ANOVA methods that apply in quite"
" different situations, but for the purposes of this chapter we’ll only "
"consider the simplest form of ANOVA, in which we have several different "
"groups of observations, and we’re interested in finding out whether those "
"groups differ in terms of some outcome variable of interest. This is the "
"question that is addressed by a **one-way ANOVA**."

"The structure of this chapter is as follows: in Section `An illustrative "
"data set <Ch13_ANOVA_01.html#an-illustrative-data-set>`__ I’ll introduce a "
"fictitious data set that we’ll use as a running example throughout the "
"chapter. After introducing the data, I’ll describe the mechanics of how a "
"one-way ANOVA actually works `How ANOVA works <Ch13_ANOVA_02.html#how-anova-"
"works>`__ and then focus on `how you can run one in jamovi "
"<Ch13_ANOVA_03.html#running-an-anova-in-jamovi>`__. These two sections are "
"the core of the chapter. The remainder of the chapter discusses a range of "
"important topics that inevitably arise when running an ANOVA, namely how to "
"calculate `effect sizes <Ch13_ANOVA_04.html#effect-size>`__, and `post-hoc "
"tests and corrections for multiple comparisons <Ch13_ANOVA_05.html#multiple-"
"comparisons-and-post-hoc-tests>`__. Afterwards, we will talk about the "
"`assumptions the ANOVA relies upon <Ch13_ANOVA_06.html#assumptions-of-the-"
"one-way-anova>`__, how to check those assumptions and some of the things you"
" can do if the assumptions are violated. Then we’ll cover `repeated measures"
" ANOVA <Ch13_ANOVA_07.html#repeated-measures-one-way-anova>`__ and it's non-"
"parametric equivalent, the `Friedman test <Ch13_ANOVA_08.html#the-friedman-"
"non-parametric-repeated-measures-anova-test>`__."
