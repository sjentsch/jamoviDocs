"One of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction "
"between “experimental research” and “non-experimental research”. When we "
"make this distinction, what we’re really talking about is the degree of "
"control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the "
"study."

"The key feature of **experimental research** is that the researcher controls"
" all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during "
"the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies the predictor"
" variables (IVs) but allows the outcome variable (DV) to vary naturally. The"
" idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (IVs) to see if they have "
"any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that "
"there’s no possibility that something other than the predictor variables is "
"causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other "
"way “balanced”, to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In "
"practice, it’s almost impossible to *think* of everything else that might "
"have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it "
"constant. The standard solution to this is **randomisation**. That is, we "
"randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a "
"different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor "
"variables). We’ll talk more about randomisation later, but for now it’s "
"enough to say that what randomisation does is minimise (but not eliminate) "
"the possibility that there are any systematic difference between groups."

"Let’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical "
"example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One "
"way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don’t smoke "
"and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is *not* "
"a proper experiment, since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over"
" who is and isn’t a smoker. And this really matters. For instance, it might "
"be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, "
"or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is"
" that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of "
"things, not *just* smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung"
" cancer among smokers is caused by something else, and not by smoking per "
"se. In technical terms these other things (e.g. diet) are called "
"“confounders”, and we’ll talk about those in just a moment."

"In the meantime, let’s consider what a proper experiment might look like. "
"Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in "
"lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to *control* "
"who smokes and who doesn’t. Specifically, if we randomly divide young non-"
"smokers into two groups and force half of them to become smokers, then it’s "
"very unlikely that the groups will differ in any respect other than the fact"
" that half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a "
"higher rate than the non-smoking group, we can feel pretty confident that "
"(a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re murderers."

"**Non-experimental research** is a broad term that covers “any study in "
"which the researcher doesn’t have as much control as they do in an "
"experiment”. Obviously, control is something that scientists like to have, "
"but as the previous example illustrates there are lots of situations in "
"which you can’t or shouldn’t try to obtain that control. Since it’s grossly "
"unethical (and almost certainly criminal) to force people to smoke in order "
"to find out if they get cancer, this is a good example of a situation in "
"which you really shouldn’t try to obtain experimental control. But there are"
" other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical issues, our “smoking "
"experiment” does have a few other issues. For instance, when I suggested "
"that we “force” half of the people to become smokers, I was talking about "
"*starting* with a sample of non-smokers, and then forcing them to become "
"smokers. While this sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design "
"that a mad scientist would love, it might not be a very sound way of "
"investigating the effect in the real world. For instance, suppose that "
"smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets, and suppose "
"also that people who normally smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, "
"since the “smokers” in our experiment aren’t “natural” smokers (i.e., we "
"forced non-smokers to become smokers, but they didn’t take on all of the "
"other normal, real life characteristics that smokers might tend to possess) "
"they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly example they "
"wouldn’t get lung cancer and our experiment will fail, because it violates "
"the structure of the “natural” world (the technical name for this is an "
"“artefactual” result)."

"One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research "
"is the difference between **quasi-experimental research** and **case "
"studies**. The example I discussed earlier, in which we wanted to examine "
"incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers without trying to "
"control who smokes and who doesn’t, is a quasi-experimental design. That is,"
" it’s the same as an experiment but we don’t control the predictors (IVs). "
"We can still use statistics to analyse the results, but we have to be a lot "
"more careful and circumspect."

"The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed "
"description of one or a few instances. In general, you can’t use statistics "
"to analyse the results of case studies and it’s usually very hard to draw "
"any general conclusions about “people in general” from a few isolated "
"examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly,"
" there are situations where you don’t have any alternative. Neuropsychology "
"has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you just can’t find a lot of people with "
"brain damage in a specific brain area, so the only thing you can do is "
"describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as much "
"care as you can. However, there’s also some genuine advantages to case "
"studies. Because you don’t have as many people to study you have the ability"
" to invest lots of time and effort trying to understand the specific factors"
" at play in each case. This is a very valuable thing to do. As a "
"consequence, case studies can complement the more statistically-oriented "
"approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We "
"won’t talk much about case studies in this book, but they are nevertheless "
"very valuable tools!"
