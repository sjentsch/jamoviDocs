"There’s a few different ways you could measure the effect size in an ANOVA, "
"but the most commonly used measures are η² (**eta squared**) and partial η²."
" For a one-way analysis of variance they’re identical to each other, so for "
"the moment I’ll just explain η². The definition of η² is actually really "
"simple"

"That’s all it is. So when I look at the ANOVA table in :numref:`fig-anova2`,"
" I see that SS\\ :sub:`b`   = 3.45 and SS\\ :sub:`tot` = 3.45 + 1.39 = 4.84."

"The interpretation of η² is equally straightforward. It refers to the "
"proportion of the variability in the outcome variable (``mood.gain``) that "
"can be explained in terms of the predictor (``drug``). A value of η² = 0 "
"means that there is no relationship at all between the two, whereas a value "
"of η = 1 means that the relationship is perfect. Better yet, the η² value is"
" very closely related to *R²*, as discussed previously in Section `The R² "
"(R-squared) value <Ch12_Regression_06.html#the-r2-r-squared-value>`__, and "
"has an equivalent interpretation."

"Although many statistics text books suggest η² as the default effect size "
"measure in ANOVA, there’s an interesting blog post by Daniel Lakens "
"suggesting that eta-squared is perhaps not the best measure of effect size "
"in real world data analysis, because it can be a biased estimator "
"(http://daniellakens.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/why-you-should-use-omega-"
"squared.html). Usefully, there is also an option in jamovi to specify omega-"
"squared (ω²), which is less biased, alongside eta-squared."
