"The statistics that we’ve discussed so far all relate to *central tendency*."
" That is, they all talk about which values are “in the middle” or “popular” "
"in the data. However, central tendency is not the only type of summary "
"statistic that we want to calculate. The second thing that we really want is"
" a measure of the **variability** of the data. That is, how “spread out” are"
" the data? How “far” away from the mean or median do the observed values "
"tend to be? For now, let’s assume that the data are interval or ratio scale,"
" and we’ll continue to use the ``afl.margins`` data. We’ll use this data to "

"The **range** of a variable is very simple. It’s the biggest value minus the"

"and the minimum value is 0. Although the range is the simplest way to "
"quantify the notion of “variability”, it’s one of the worst. Recall from our"
" discussion of the mean that we want our summary measure to be robust. If "
"the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it we’d like our "
"statistics to not be unduly influenced by these cases. For example, in a "

" it’s a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to "
"think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by"
" the “middle half” of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below"
" the 25th percentile and one quarter of the data is above the 75th "
"percentile, leaving the “middle half” of the data lying in between the two. "

"The two measures we’ve looked at so far, the range and the interquartile "
"range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by "
"looking at the percentiles of the data. However, this isn’t the only way to "
"think about the problem. A different approach is to select a meaningful "
"reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the "
"“typical” deviations from that reference point. What do we mean by “typical”"
" deviation? Usually, this is the mean or median value of these deviations. "
"In practice, this leads to two different measures: the “mean absolute "
"deviation” (from the mean) and the “median absolute deviation” (from the "
"median). From what I’ve read, the measure based on the median seems to be "
"used in statistics and does seem to be the better of the two. But to be "
"honest I don’t think I’ve seen it used much in psychology. The measure based"
" on the mean does occasionally show up in psychology though. In this section"
" I’ll talk about the first one, and I’ll come back to talk about the second "
"one later."

"Since the previous paragraph might sound a little abstract, let’s go through"
" the **mean absolute deviation** from the mean a little more slowly. One "
"useful thing about this measure is that the name actually tells you exactly "
"how to calculate it. Let’s think about our AFL winning margins data, and "
"once again we’ll start by pretending that there are only 5 games in total, "
"with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on"
" an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case the"
" mean), the first thing we need to calculate is the mean, :math:`\\bar{X}`. "
"For these five observations, our mean is :math:`\\bar{X}` = 36.6. The next "
"step is to convert each of our observations X\\ :sub:`i` into a deviation "
"score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation X\\ "
":sub:`i` and the mean :math:`\\bar{X}`. That is, the deviation score is "
"defined to be :math:`X_i - \\bar{X}`. For the first observation in our "
"sample, this is equal to 56 - 36.6 = 19.4. Okay, that’s simple enough. The "
"next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute "
"deviations, and we do this by converting any negative values to positive "
"ones. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of -3 as \\|-3\\|, "
"and so we say that \\|-3\\| = 3`. We use the absolute value here because we "
"don’t really care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than "
"the mean, we’re just interested in how *close* it is to the mean. To help "
"make this process as obvious as possible, the table below shows these "
"calculations for all five observations:"

"That last column contains all of our squared deviations, so all we have to "

"So that’s the *what*. The real question is *why* jamovi is dividing by *N - "

"number of observations in the sample? Well, yes, we should. However, as "
"we’ll discuss in Chapter `Estimating unknown quantities from a sample "
"<Ch08_Estimation.html#estimating-unknown-quantities-from-a-sample>`__, "
"there’s a subtle distinction between “describing a sample” and “making "
"guesses about the population from which the sample came”. Up to this point, "
"it’s been a distinction without a difference. Regardless of whether you’re "
"describing a sample or drawing inferences about the population, the mean is "
"calculated exactly the same way. Not so for the variance, or the standard "
"deviation, or for many other measures besides. What I outlined to you "
"initially (i.e., take the actual average, and thus divide by *N*) assumes "
"that you literally intend to calculate the variance of the sample. Most of "
"the time, however, you’re not terribly interested in the sample *in and of "
"itself*. Rather, the sample exists to tell you something about the world. If"
" so, you’re actually starting to move away from calculating a “sample "
"statistic” and towards the idea of estimating a “population parameter”. "
"However, I’m getting ahead of myself. For now, let’s just take it on faith "

"Okay, one last thing. This section so far has read a bit like a mystery "

"outliers and as a consequence it isn’t often used unless you have good "
"reasons to care about the extremes in the data."

"*Mean absolute deviation*. Tells you how far “on average” the observations "

"discussed here) that make it less attractive to statisticians than the "
"standard deviation. Used sometimes, but not often."

"*Variance*. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It’s "
"mathematically elegant and is probably the “right” way to describe variation"
" around the mean, but it’s completely uninterpretable because it doesn’t use"
" the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical "
"tool, but it’s buried “under the hood” of a very large number of statistical"
" tools."

"*Standard deviation*. This is the square root of the variance. It’s fairly "
"elegant mathematically and it’s expressed in the same units as the data so "
"it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the "
"measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most "
"popular measure of variation."

"In short, the IQR and the standard deviation are easily the two most common "

"Well, I will very briefly mention the one that I think is coolest, for a "
"very particular definition of “cool”, that is. Variances are *additive*. "
"Here’s what that means. Suppose I have two variables X and Y, whose "
"variances are Var(X) and Var(Y) respectively. Now imagine I want to define a"
" new variable Z that is the sum of the two, Z = X + Y. As it turns out, the "
"variance of Z is equal to Var(X) + Var(Y). This is a *very* useful property,"
" but it’s not true of the other measures that I talk about in this section."
