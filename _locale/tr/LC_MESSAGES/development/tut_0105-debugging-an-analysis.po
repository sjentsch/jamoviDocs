"In this example, our code is only one line of code, so we can be reasonably "
"confident where the problem lies. However, in practice software can be two "
"or three or even more lines of code. In more complex situations, it can be "
"handy to have a ‘stack trace’ which tells us where the problem occurred. "
"jamovi can be placed in ‘dev mode’, which displays stack traces when errors "
"occur. dev mode can be toggled from the app menu to the top right of the "
"jamovi window:"
