"This comparison shows how a Spearman’s correlation is conducted in SPSS "
"and jamovi. The SPSS test follows the description in chapter 8.4.3 in "
"`Field (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially output "
"8.2. It uses the data set **The Biggest Liar.sav** which can be "
"downloaded from the `web page accompanying the book "
"<https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e/student-resources/datasets>`__."
