"This comparison shows how a t-test for independent samples is performed "
"in SPSS and jamovi. As a first step, it demonstrates the calculation of "
"the statistics underlying the t-test for paired samples. For this "
"calculation, first, the average number of mischieveous acts for each "
"person is calculated before a mean of these individual averages is "
"calculated for the whole group. The individual is then adjusted for that "
"group mean. The aim of this calculation is to show that by using repeated"
" measurements, one can “control” for some proportion of the variance "
"which is caused by individual differences in performance. In connection "
"with this, the standard error of mean becomes smaller (which means that "
"effects easier can become significant (as compared to a between-subjects "
"design). This is described in chapter 10.9.2 of `Field (2017) "
"<https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially Figure 10.7 to 10.10. "
"It uses the data set **Invisibility RM.sav** which can be downloaded from"
" the `web page accompanying the book <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e"
"/student-resources/datasets>`__. The data set describes a repeated-"
"measures-design where first the “baseline”-number of mischieveous acts "
"(during one week) is determined for each participant (variable "
"``No_Cloak``) before they are handed a cloak that makes them invisible. "
"After receiving the cloak, the number of mischieveous acts is recorded "
"for the following week (variable ``Cloak``) during which they can make "
"themselves invisible (which is assumed to increase the number of "
"mischieveous acts committed)."
