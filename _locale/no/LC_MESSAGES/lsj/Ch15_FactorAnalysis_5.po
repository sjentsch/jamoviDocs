"After you have been through the process of initial scale development using "
"EFA and CFA, you should have reached a stage where the scale holds up pretty"
" well using CFA with different samples. One thing that you might also be "
"interested in at this stage is to see how well the factors are measured "
"using a scale that combines the observed variables."

"In psychometrics we use reliability analysis to provide information about "
"how consistently a scale measures a psychological construct (see Section "
"`Assessing the reliability of a measurement <Ch02_StudyDesign_3.html"
"#assessing-the-reliability-of-a-measurement>`__). **Internal consistency** "
"is what we are concerned with here, and that refers to the consistency "
"across all the individual items that make up a measurement scale. So, if we "
"have V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5 as observed item variables, then we can calculate"
" a statistic that tells us how internally consistent these items are in "
"measuring the underlying construct."

"A popular statistic used to check the internal consistency of a scale is "
"**Cronbach’s *α** (alpha; `Cronbach, 1951 "
"<References.html#cronbach-1951>`__\\ ). Cronbach’s *α* is a measure of "
"equivalence (whether different sets of scale items would give the same "
"measurement outcomes). Equivalence is tested by dividing the scale items "
"into two groups (a “split-half”) and seeing whether analysis of the two "
"parts gives comparable results. Of course, there are many ways a set of "
"items could be split, but if all possible splits are made then it is "
"possible to produce a statistic that reflects the overall pattern of split-"
"half coefficients. Cronbach’s *α* is such a statistic: a function of all the"
" split-half coefficients for a scale. If a set of items that measure a "
"construct (e.g. an Extraversion scale) has an *α* of 0.80, then the "
"proportion of error variance in the scale is 0.20. In other words, a scale "
"with an *α* of 0.80 includes approximately 20% error."

"BUT, (and that’s a BIG “BUT”), Cronbach’s *α* is not a measure of "
"unidimensionality (i.e. an indicator that a scale is measuring a single "
"factor or construct rather than multiple related constructs). Scales that "
"are multidimensional will cause *α* to be under-estimated if not assessed "
"separately for each dimension, but high values for *α* are not necessarily "
"indicators of unidimensionality. So, an *α* of 0.80 does not mean that 80% "
"of a single underlying construct is accounted for. It could be that the 80% "
"comes from more than one underlying construct. That’s why EFA and CFA are "
"useful to do first."

"Further, another feature of *α* is that it tends to be sample specific: it "
"is not a characteristic of the scale, but rather a characteristic of the "
"sample in which the scale has been used. A biased, unrepresentative, or "
"small sample could produce a very different *α* coefficient than a large, "
"representative sample. *α* can even vary from large sample to large sample. "
"Nevertheless, despite these limitations, Cronbach’s *α* has been popular in "
"Psychology for estimating internal consistency reliability. It’s pretty easy"
" to calculate, understand and interpret, and therefore it can be a useful "
"initial check on scale performance when you administer a scale with a "
"different sample, from a different setting or population, for example."

"An alternative is **McDonald’s ω** (omega), and jamovi also provides this "
"statistic. Whereas *α* makes the following assumptions: (a) no residual "
"correlations, (b) items have identical loadings, and (c) the scale is "
"unidimensional, *ω* does not and is therefore a more robust reliability "
"statistic. If these assumptions are not violated then *α* and *ω* will be "
"similar, but if they are then *ω* is to be preferred."

"Sometimes a threshold for *α* or *ω* is provided, suggesting a “good enough”"
" value. This might be something like *α*s of 0.70 or 0.80 representing "
"“acceptable” and “good” reliability, respectively. However, this does depend"
" on what exactly the scale is supposed to be measuring, so thresholds like "
"this should be used cautiously. It could be better to simply state that an "
"*α* or *ω* of 0.70 is associated with 30% error variance in a scale, and an "
"*α* or *ω* of 0.80 is associated with 20%."

"Can *α* be too high? Probably: if you are getting an *α* coefficient above "
"0.95 then this indicates high inter-correlations between the items and that "
"there might be too much overly-redundant specificity in the measurement, "
"with a risk that the construct being measured is perhaps overly narrow."
