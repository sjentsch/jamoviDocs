"It is very commonly the case that you find yourself needing to look at "
"descriptive statistics broken down by some grouping variable. This is pretty"
" easy to do in jamovi. For instance, let’s say I want to look at the "
"descriptive statistics for some ``clin.trial`` data, broken down separately "
"by ``therapy`` type. This is a new data set, one that you’ve never seen "
"before. The data is stored in the ``clinicaltrial.csv`` file and we’ll use "
"it a lot in Chapter `Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) "
"<Ch13_ANOVA.html#comparing-several-means-one-way-anova>`__ (you can find a "
"complete description of the data at the start of that chapter). Let’s load "
"it and see what we’ve got:"

"Evidently there were three drugs: a placebo, something called “anxifree” and"
" something called “joyzepam”, and there were 6 people administered each "
"drug. There were 9 people treated using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) "
"and 9 people who received no psychological treatment. And we can see from "
"looking at the ``Descriptives`` of the ``mood.gain`` variable that most "
"people did show a mood gain (mean = 0.88), though without knowing what the "
"scale is here it’s hard to say much more than that. Still, that’s not too "
"bad. Overall I feel that I learned something from that."

"We can also go ahead and look at some other descriptive statistics, and this"
" time separately for each type of therapy. In jamovi, check Std. deviation, "
"Skewness and Kurtosis in the ``Statistics`` options. At the same time, "
"transfer the ``therapy`` variable into the ``Split by`` box, and you should "
"get something like :numref:`fig-clinicaltrial_grouping`."

"What if you have multiple grouping variables? Suppose you want to look at "
"the average mood gain separately for all possible combinations of drug and "
"therapy. It is possible to do this by adding another variable, ``drug``, "
"into the ``Split by`` box. Easy peasy, though sometimes if you split too "
"much there isn’t enough data in each breakdown combination to make "
"meaningful calculations. In this case jamovi tells you this by stating "
"something like ``NaN`` or ``Inf``.\\ [#]_"

"Sometimes jamovi will also present numbers in an unusual way. If a number is"
" very small, or very large, then jamovi switches to an exponential form for "
"numbers. For example **6.51e-4** is the same as saying that the decimal "
"point is moved 4 places to the left, so the actual number is **0.000651**. "
"If there is a plus sign (i.e. **6.51e+4** then the decimal point is moved to"
" the right, i.e. **65,100.00**. Usually only very small or very large "
"numbers are expressed in this way, for example **6.51e-16**, which would be "
"quite unwieldy to write out in the normal way."
