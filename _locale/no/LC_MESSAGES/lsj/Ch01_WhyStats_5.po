"When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news "
"articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned out"
" that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call a "
"statistical topic and 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error, if "
"you’re curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the article "
"mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some characteristic Y, but "
"doesn’t say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!). The point "
"I’m trying to make here isn’t that journalists are bad at statistics (though"
" they almost always are), it’s that a basic knowledge of statistics is very "
"helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a "
"mistake or even lying to you. In fact, one of the biggest things that a "
"knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the "
"newspaper or the internet on a far more frequent basis. You can find a good "
"example of this in the section `A real life example "
"<Ch04_Descriptives_1.html#a-real-life-example>`__. In later versions of this"
" book I’ll try to include more anecdotes along those lines."

"So far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be "
"forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be "
"fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader "
"concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a lot "
"of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in"
" particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with "
"humans. However, about 99% of student *fears* relate to the statistics part "
"of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this discussion, and "
"hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, "
"that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s pretty typical for "
"introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not "
"(usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in "
"fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost "
"always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research "
"methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other "
"classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than "
"they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate "
"assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in "
"which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it *is* "
"common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were "
"collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need "
"statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well "
"in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent."

"But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. I "
"really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data "
"analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, "
"while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core "
"tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research"
" methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some general principles "
"that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very "
"idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to "
"engage in. To the extent that it’s the details that matter, those details "
"don’t usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class."
