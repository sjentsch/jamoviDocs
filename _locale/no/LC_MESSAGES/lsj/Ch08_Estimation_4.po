"In all the IQ examples in the previous sections we actually knew the "
"population parameters ahead of time. As every undergraduate gets taught in "
"their very first lecture on the measurement of intelligence, IQ scores are "
"*defined* to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15. However, this is a bit"
" of a lie. How do we know that IQ scores have a true population mean of 100?"
" Well, we know this because the people who designed the tests have "
"administered them to very large samples, and have then “rigged” the scoring "
"rules so that their sample has mean 100. That’s not a bad thing of course, "
"it’s an important part of designing a psychological measurement. However, "
"it’s important to keep in mind that this theoretical mean of 100 only "
"attaches to the population that the test designers used to design the tests."
" Good test designers will actually go to some lengths to provide “test "
"norms” that can apply to lots of different populations (e.g., different age "
"groups, nationalities etc)."

"This is very handy, but of course almost every research project of interest "
"involves looking at a different population of people to those used in the "
"test norms. For instance, suppose you wanted to measure the effect of low "
"level lead poisoning on cognitive functioning in Port Pirie, a South "
"Australian industrial town with a lead smelter. Perhaps you decide that you "
"want to compare IQ scores among people in Port Pirie to a comparable sample "
"in Whyalla, a South Australian industrial town with a steel refinery.\\ [#]_"
" Regardless of which town you’re thinking about, it doesn’t make a lot of "
"sense simply to *assume* that the true population mean IQ is 100. No-one "
"has, to my knowledge, produced sensible norming data that can automatically "
"be applied to South Australian industrial towns. We’re going to have to "
"**estimate** the population parameters from a sample of data. So how do we "
"do this?"

"Suppose we go to Port Pirie and 100 of the locals are kind enough to sit "

":math:`\\bar{X}` = 98.5. So what is the true mean IQ for the entire "
"population of Port Pirie? Obviously, we don’t know the answer to that "
"question. It could be 97.2, but it could also be 103.5. Our sampling isn’t "

"for the moment what I want to do is make sure you recognise that the sample "

"different things. A sample statistic is a description of your data, whereas "
"the estimate is a guess about the population. With that in mind, "
"statisticians often different notation to refer to them. For instance, if "
"the true population mean is denoted *µ*, then we would use :math:`\\hat\\mu`"

" samples the estimate of the population mean is identical to the sample "
"mean. If I observe a sample mean of :math:`\\bar{X}` = 98.5 then my estimate"
" of the population mean is also :math:`\\hat\\mu` = 98.5. To help keep the "

"So far, estimation seems pretty simple, and you might be wondering why I "

" of the mean our estimate of the population parameter (i.e. "
":math:`\\hat\\mu`) turned out to identical to the corresponding sample "

"this, let’s have a think about how to construct an **estimate of the "
"population standard deviation**, which we’ll denote :math:`\\hat\\sigma`. "
"What shall we use as our estimate in this case? Your first thought might be "

"anything at all about what “cromulence” is, but we know something about "
"data. The only reason that we don’t see any variability in the *sample* is "
"that the sample is too small to display any variation! So, if you have a "

"forced to guess we’d probably guess that the population mean cromulence is "
"21. What about the standard deviation? This is a little more complicated. "

"One final point. In practice, a lot of people tend to refer to "
":math:`\\hat{\\sigma}` (i.e., the formula where we divide by *N* - 1) as the"
" *sample* standard deviation. Technically, this is incorrect. The *sample* "
"standard deviation should be equal to *s* (i.e., the formula where we divide"
" by *N*). These aren’t the same thing, either conceptually or numerically. "
"One is a property of the sample, the other is an estimated characteristic of"
" the population. However, in almost every real life application what we "

"people always report :math:`\\hat\\sigma` rather than *s*. This is the right"

"It’s never a good idea to confuse “known properties of your sample” with "
