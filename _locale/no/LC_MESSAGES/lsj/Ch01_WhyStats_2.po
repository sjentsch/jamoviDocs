"People are mostly pretty smart. We’re certainly smarter than the other "
"species that we share the planet with (though many people might disagree). "
"Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most "
"incredible feats of thought and reason. That doesn’t make us perfect though."
" And among the many things that psychologists have shown over the years is "
"that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence "
"impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example "
"of this is the **belief bias effect** in logical reasoning: if you ask "
"people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., "
"conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be "
"influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldn’t. "
"For instance, here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is believable:"

"The logical *structure* of argument #2 is identical to the structure of "
"argument #1, and they’re both valid. However, in the second argument, there "
"are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result it’s "
"probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But that’s entirely"
" irrelevant to the topic at hand; an argument is deductively valid if the "
"conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid "
"argument doesn’t have to involve true statements."

"Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-"

"arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at this, you’d "

"If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation to "

" hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did so 46% of"

"If you think about it, it’s not as if these data are horribly damning. "
"Overall, people did do better than chance at compensating for their prior "
"biases, since about 60% of people’s judgements were correct (you’d expect "
"50% by chance). Even so, if you were a professional “evaluator of evidence”,"
" and someone came along and offered you a magic tool that improves your "
"chances of making the right decision from 60% to (say) 95%, you’d probably "
"jump at it, right? Of course you would. Thankfully, we actually do have a "
"tool that can do this. But it’s not magic, it’s statistics. So that’s reason"
" #1 why scientists love statistics. It’s just *too easy* for us to “believe "
"what we want to believe”. So instead, if we want to “believe in the data”, "
"we’re going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control."
" That’s what statistics does, it helps keep us honest."
