"In Chapter `Categorical data analysis <Ch10_ChiSquare.html#categorical-data-"
"analysis>`__ we covered the situation when your outcome variable is nominal "
"scale and your predictor variable is also nominal scale. Lots of real world "
"situations have that character, and so you’ll find that χ²-tests in "
"particular are quite widely used. However, you’re much more likely to find "
"yourself in a situation where your outcome variable is interval scale or "
"higher, and what you’re interested in is whether the average value of the "
"outcome variable is higher in one group or another. For instance, a "
"psychologist might want to know if anxiety levels are higher among parents "
"than non-parents, or if working memory capacity is reduced by listening to "
"music (relative to not listening to music). In a medical context we might "
"want to know if a new drug increases or decreases blood pressure. An "
"agricultural scientist might want to know whether adding phosphorus to "
"Australian native plants will kill them.\\ [#]_ In all these situations our "
"outcome variable is a fairly continuous, interval or ratio scale variable, "
"and our predictor is a binary “grouping” variable. In other words, we want "
"to compare the means of the two groups."

"The standard answer to the problem of comparing means is to use a *t*-test, "
"of which there are several varieties depending on exactly what question you "
"want to solve. As a consequence, the majority of this chapter focuses on "
"different types of *t*-test: `one sample t-tests <Ch11_tTest_02.html#the-"
"one-sample-t-test>`__ are discussed first, followed by two different "
"flavours of the `independent samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_03.html#the-"
"independent-samples-t-test-student-test>`__, the `Student test "
"<Ch11_tTest_03.html#the-independent-samples-t-test-student-test>`__ assumes "
"that the groups have the same standard deviation, the `Welch test "
"<Ch11_tTest_04.html#the-independent-samples-t-test-welch-test>`__ does not. "
"Afterwards, `paired samples t-tests <Ch11_tTest_05.html#the-paired-"
"samples-t-test>`__ are discussed. We’ll then talk about `One-sided tests "
"<Ch11_tTest_06.html#one-sided-tests>`__ and, after that, we’ll talk a bit "
"about Cohen’s *d*, which is the standard measure of `effect size "
"<Ch11_tTest_07.html#effect-size>`__ for a *t*-test. The later sections of "
"the chapter focus on the assumptions of the *t*-tests, especially "
"`normality` <Ch11_tTest_08.html#checking-the-normality-of-a-sample>`__ and "
"possible `remedies <Ch11_tTest_09.html#testing-non-normal-data-with-"
"wilcoxon-tests>`__ if they are violated. However, before discussing any of "
"these useful things, we’ll start with a discussion of the *z*-test."

"Informal experimentation in my garden suggests that yes, it does. Australian"
" natives are adapted to low phosphorus levels relative to everywhere else on"
" Earth, so if you’ve bought a house with a bunch of exotics and you want to "
"plant natives, keep them separate; nutrients to European plants are poison "
"to Australian ones."
