"The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ; `Hewitt et al. (2004) "

"We could depict this as in the diagram in :numref:`fig-MTMM3`, which shows "

"At the same time, we should consider whether there is any good, systematic, "
"reason for some of the error terms to be correlated with each other. "
"Thinking back to the ASQ questions, there were three different sub-questions"
" (a, b and c) for each main question (1-6). Q1 was about unsuccessful job "
"hunting and it is plausible that this question has some distinctive "
"artefactual or methodological aspects over and above the other questions "
"(2-5), something to do with job hunting perhaps. Similarly, Q2 was about not"
" helping a friend with a problem, and there may be some distinctive "
"artefactual or methodological aspects to do with not helping a friend that "
"is not present in the other questions (1, and 3-5)."

"So, as well as multiple factors, we also have multiple methodological "
"features in the ASQ, where each of Questions 1-6 has a slightly different "
"“method”, but each “method” is shared across the sub-questions a, b and c. "
"In order to incorporate these different methodological features into the "
"model we can specify that certain error terms are correlated with each "
"other. For example, the errors associated with ``INT1``, ``STAB1`` and "
"``GLOB1`` should be correlated with each other to reflect the distinct and "
"shared methodological variance of Q1a, Q1b and Q1c. Looking at :numref:`fig-"
"MTMM2`, this means that as well as the latent factors represented by the "
"columns, we will have correlated measurement errors for the variables in "

"Whilst a basic CFA model like the one shown in :numref:`fig-MTMM3` could be "

"Once we have set up the analysis we can turn our attention to the jamovi "

"else is set to zero, so model fit is testing both whether the pre-specified "

"There are several ways of assessing model fit. The first is a χ²-statistic, "
"which if small indicates that the model is a good fit to the data. However, "
"the χ²-statistic used for assessing model fit is very sensitive to sample "
"size, meaning that with a large sample (more than 300-400 cases) a good "
"enough fit between the model and the data almost always produces a large and"
" significant χ²-value."

#: ../../lsj/Ch15_FactorAnalysis_4.rst:212

"So, we need some other ways of assessing model fit. In jamovi several are "
"provided by default. These are the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker "
"Fit Index (TFI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) "
"together with the 90% confidence interval for the RMSEA. As we mentioned "
"previously, some useful rules of thumb are that a satisfactory fit is "
"indicated by CFI > \\0.9, TFI > 0.9, and RMSEA of about 0.05 to 0.08. A good"

"So, looking at :numref:`fig-MTMM6` we can see that the χ²-value is highly "

"2748). The CFI is 0.98 and the TLI is also \\0.98, indicating a very good "
"fit. The RMSEA is 0.02 with a 90% confidence interval from 0.02 to 0.02 – "
"pretty tight!"

"What we are looking for is the highest modification index (MI) value. We "
