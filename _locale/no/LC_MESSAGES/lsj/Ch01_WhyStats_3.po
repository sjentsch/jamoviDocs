" nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in admission rates between "

"Remarkably, most departments had a *higher* rate of admissions for females "

"Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are *not* equal"
" to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments "
"(e.g., A, B) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, "
"whereas others (e.g., F) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if "
"they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice "
"that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that"
" order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different "
"departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male"
" applicants, we get **A** > **B** > D > C > F > E (the “easy” departments "
"are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that "
"had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants "
"distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number"
" of female applicants produces a quite different ordering C > E > D > F > "
"**A** > **B**. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that"
" the female applicants tended to apply to “harder” departments. And in fact,"
" if we look at :numref:`fig-berkeley` we see that this trend is systematic, "
"and quite striking. This effect is known as **Simpson’s paradox**. It’s not "
"common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised "
"by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe "
"that it’s real. It is very real. And while there are lots of very subtle "
"statistical lessons buried in there, I want to use it to make a much more "
"important point: doing research is hard, and there are *lots* of subtle, "
"counter-intuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. That’s reason #2 why "
"scientists love statistics, and why we teach research methods. Because "
"science is hard, and the truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks "
"and crannies of complicated data."

"The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the admission "
"rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female applicant, as a "
"function of the percentage of applicants that were female. The plot is a "
"redrawing of Figure 1 from `Bickel et al. (1975) "
"<References.html#bickel-1975>`__. Circles plot departments with more than 40"
" applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total number of "
"applicants. The crosses plot departments with fewer than 40 applicants."

"Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else "
"really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class. "
"Statistics only solves *part* of the problem. Remember that we started all "
"this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be unfairly"
" biased against female applicants. When we looked at the “aggregated” data, "
"it did seem like the university was discriminating against women, but when "
"we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual behaviour of all the "
"departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, "
"slightly biased in favour of women. The gender bias in total admissions was "
"caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. "
"From a legal perspective, that would probably put the university in the "
"clear. Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual"
" department, and there are good reasons to do that. At the level of "
"individual departments the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak "
"bias in favour of females at that level is small, and not consistent across "
"departments). Since the university can’t dictate which departments people "
"choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the "
"department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those "
"choices produce."

"That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but that’s not "
"exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we’re interested in this from "
"a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask "
"*why* there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males"
" tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this "
"reversed for the English department? And why is it the case that the "
"departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower "
"overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application "
"bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single "
"department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males"
" preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and females prefer “humanities”. And "
"suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low "
"admission rates is because the government doesn’t want to fund the "
"humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded "
"research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an "
"unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high"
" level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the"
" humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty *blatantly* gender "
"biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters "
"to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall structural "
"effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at *both* "
"the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision "
"making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in "
"the disaggregated data."

"In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer with "
"statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on "
"how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should "
"always think of statistics as a *tool* to help you learn about your data. No"
" more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but there’s no "
"substitute for careful thought."
