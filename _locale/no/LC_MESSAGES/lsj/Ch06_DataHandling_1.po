"A very common task when analysing data is the construction of frequency "
"tables, or cross-tabulation of one variable against another. These tasks can"
" be achieved in jamovi and I’ll show you how in this section."

"Let’s start with a simple example. As a parent of a small child I naturally "
"spend a lot of time watching TV shows like *In the Night Garden*. In the "
"``nightgarden.csv`` file, I’ve transcribed a short section of the dialogue. "
"The file contains two variables of interest, ``speaker`` and ``utterance``. "
"Open up this data set in jamovi and take a look at the data in the ``Data`` "
"view. You will see that the data looks something like this:"

"Looking at this it becomes very clear what happened to my sanity! With these"
" as my data, one task I might find myself needing to do is construct a "
"frequency count of the number of words each character speaks during the "
"show. The jamovi ``Descriptives`` screen has a check box called ``Frequency "
"tables`` which does just this, see :numref:`fig-freqtable`."

"The output here tells us on the first line that what we’re looking at is a "
"tabulation of the ``speaker`` variable. In the ``Levels`` column it lists "
"all the different speakers that exist in the data, and in the ``Counts`` "
"column it tells you how many times that speaker appears in the data. In "
"other words, it’s a frequency table."

"In jamovi, the ``Frequency tables`` check box will only produce a table for "
"single variables. For a table of two variables, for example combining "
"``speaker`` and ``utterance`` so that we can see how many times each speaker"
" said a particular utterance, we need a cross-tabulation or contingency "
"table. In jamovi you can do this by selecting the ``Frequencies`` → "
"``Contingency Tables`` → ``Independent Samples`` analysis, and moving the "
"``speaker`` variable into the ``Rows`` box, and the ``utterances`` variable "
"into the ``Columns`` box. You then should have a contingency table like the "
"one shown in :numref:`fig-contingencytable`."

"Don’t worry about the “χ² Tests” table that is produced. We are going to "
"cover this later on in chapter `Categorical data analysis "
"<Ch10_ChiSquare.html#categorical-data-analysis>`__. When interpreting the "
"contingency table remember that these are counts, so the fact that the first"
" row and second column of numbers corresponds to a value of 2 indicates that"
" ``makka-pakka`` (row 1) says ``onk`` (column 2) twice in this data set."

"The contingency table shown in :numref:`fig-contingencytable` shows a table "
"of raw frequencies. That is, a count of the total number of cases for "
"different combinations of levels of the specified variables. However, often "
"you want your data to be organised in terms of percentages as well as "
"counts. You can find the check boxes for different percentages under the "
"``Cells`` option in the ``Contingency Tables`` window. First, click on the "
"``Row`` check box and the Contingency Table in the output window will change"
" to the one in :numref:`fig-contingencyrow`."

"What we’re looking at here is the percentage of utterances made by each "
"character. In other words, 50% of ``makka-pakka``’s utterances are ``pip``, "
"and the other 50% are ``onk``. Let’s contrast this with the table we get "
"when we calculate column percentages (uncheck ``Row`` and check ``Column`` "
"in the ``Cells`` options window), see :numref:`fig-contingencycol`. In this "
"version, what we’re seeing is the percentage of characters associated with "
"each utterance. For instance, whenever the utterance ``ee`` is made (in this"
" data set), 100% of the time it’s a Tombliboo saying it."
