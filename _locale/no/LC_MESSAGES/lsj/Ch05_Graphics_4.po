"Perhaps I’m a simple minded person, but I love pictures. Every time I write "
"a new scientific paper one of the first things I do is sit down and think "
"about what the pictures will be. In my head an article is really just a "
"sequence of pictures linked together by a story. All the rest of it is just "
"window dressing. What I’m really trying to say here is that the human visual"
" system is a very powerful data analysis tool. Give it the right kind of "
"information and it will supply a human reader with a massive amount of "
"knowledge very quickly. Not for nothing do we have the saying “a picture is "
"worth a thousand words”. With that in mind, I think that this is one of the "
"most important chapters in the book. The topics covered were:"

"*Common plots*. Much of the chapter was focused on standard graphs that "
"statisticians like to produce: `histograms "
"<Ch05_Graphics_1.html#histograms>`__, `box plots <Ch05_Graphics_2.html#box-"
"plots>`__ and `bar graphs <Ch05_Graphics_3.html#bar-graphs>`__."

"One final thing to point out. Whilst jamovi produces some really neat "
"default graphics, editing the plots is currently not possible. For more "
"advanced graphics and plotting capability the packages available in R are "
"much more powerful. One of the most popular graphics systems is provided by "
"the ``ggplot2`` package (see http://ggplot2.org/), which is loosely based on"
" “The grammar of graphics” (`Wilkinson, 2006 "
"<References.html#wilkinson-2006>`__\\ ). It’s not for novices. You need to "
"have a pretty good grasp of R before you can start using it, and even then "
"it takes a while to really get the hang of it. But when you’re ready it’s "
"worth taking the time to teach yourself, because it’s a much more powerful "
"and cleaner system."
