"`The χ² (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test <Ch10_ChiSquare_1.html#the-2-chi-"
"square-goodness-of-fit-test>`__ is used when you have a table of observed "
"frequencies of different categories, and the null hypothesis gives you a set"
" of “known” probabilities to compare them to."

"`The χ² (chi-square) test of independence <Ch10_ChiSquare_2.html#the-2-chi-"
"square-test-of-independence-or-association>`__ is used when you have a "
"contingency table (cross-tabulation) of two categorical variables. The null "
"hypothesis is that there is no relationship or association between the "
"variables."

"`Effect size <Ch10_ChiSquare_4.html#effect-size>`__ for a contingency table "
"can be measured in several ways. In particular we noted the Cramér’s *V* "
"statistic."

"Both versions of the Pearson test rely on two `assumptions "
"<Ch10_ChiSquare_5.html#assumptions-of-the-test-s>`__: that the expected "
"frequencies are sufficiently large, and that the observations are "
"independent. The `Fisher exact test <Ch10_ChiSquare_6.html#the-fisher-exact-"
"test>`__ can be used when the expected frequencies are small. The `McNemar "
"test <Ch10_ChiSquare_7.html#the-mcnemar-test>`__ can be used for some kinds "
"of violations of independence."

"If you’re interested in learning more about categorical data analysis a good"
" first choice would be `Agresti (2018) <References.html#agresti-2018>`__ "
"which, as the title suggests, provides an *Introduction to Categorical Data "
"Analysis*. If the introductory book isn’t enough for you (or can’t solve the"
" problem you’re working on) you could consider `Agresti (2012) "
"<References.html#agresti-2012>`__, *Categorical Data Analysis*. The latter "
"is a more advanced text, so it’s probably not wise to jump straight from "
"this book to that one."
