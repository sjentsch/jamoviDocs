"The linear regression model that I’ve been discussing relies on several "
"assumptions. In Section `Model checking <Ch12_Regression_10.html#model-"
"checking>`__ we’ll talk a lot more about how to check that these assumptions"
" are being met, but first let’s have a look at each of them."

"*Normality*. Like many of the models in statistics, basic simple or multiple"
" linear regression relies on an assumption of normality. Specifically, it "
"assumes that the *residuals* are normally distributed. It’s actually okay if"
" the predictors *X* and the outcome *Y* are non-normal, so long as the "
"residuals ε are normal. See Section `Checking the normality of the residuals"
" <Ch12_Regression_10.html#checking-the-normality-of-the-residuals>`__."

"*Linearity*. A pretty fundamental assumption of the linear regression model "
"is that the relationship between *X* and *Y* actually is linear! Regardless "
"of whether it’s a simple regression or a multiple regression, we assume that"
" the relationships involved are linear."

msgid ""
"*Homogeneity of variance*. Strictly speaking, the regression model assumes "
"that each residual ε\\ :sub:`i` is generated from a normal distribution with"
" mean 0, and (more importantly for the current purposes) with a standard "
"deviation *σ* that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it’s "
"impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically "
"distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of "
"the residual is the same for all values of *Ŷ*, and (if we’re being "
"especially paranoid) all values of every predictor *X* in the model."

"*Uncorrelated predictors*. The idea here is that, in a multiple regression "
"model, you don’t want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with "
"each other. This isn’t “technically” an assumption of the regression model, "
"but in practice it’s required. Predictors that are too strongly correlated "
"with each other (referred to as “collinearity”) can cause problems when "
"evaluating the model. See Section `Checking for collinearity "
"<Ch12_Regression_10.html#checking-for-collinearity>`__."

"*Residuals are independent of each other*. This is really just a “catch all”"
" assumption, to the effect that “there’s nothing else funny going on in the "
"residuals”. If there is something weird (e.g., the residuals all depend "
"heavily on some other unmeasured variable) going on, it might screw things "
"up."

"*No “bad” outliers*. Again, not actually a technical assumption of the model"
" (or rather, it’s sort of implied by all the others), but there is an "
"implicit assumption that your regression model isn’t being too strongly "
"influenced by one or two anomalous data points because this raises questions"
" about the adequacy of the model and the trustworthiness of the data in some"
" cases. See Section `Three kinds of anomalous data <Ch12_Regression_10.html"
"#three-kinds-of-anomalous-data>`__."
