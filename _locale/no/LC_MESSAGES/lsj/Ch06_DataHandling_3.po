"It’s not uncommon in real world data analysis to find that one of your "
"variables isn’t quite equivalent to the variable that you really want. For "
"instance, it’s often convenient to take a continuous-valued variable (e.g., "
"age) and break it up into a smallish number of categories (e.g., younger, "
"middle, older). At other times, you may need to convert a numeric variable "
"into a different numeric variable (e.g., you may want to analyse at the "
"absolute value of the original variable). In this section I’ll describe a "
"few key ways you can do these things in jamovi."

"The first trick to discuss is the idea of **transforming** a variable. Taken"
" literally, *anything* you do to a variable is a transformation, but in "
"practice what it usually means is that you apply a relatively simple "
"mathematical function to the original variable in order to create a new "
"variable that either (a) provides a better way of describing the thing "
"you’re actually interested in, or (b) is more closely in agreement with the "
"assumptions of the statistical tests you want to do. Since, at this stage, I"
" haven’t talked about statistical tests or their assumptions, I’ll show you "
"an example based on the first case."

"Now let’s load and look at the data. The data file ``likert.omv`` contains a"
" single variable that contains raw Likert-scale responses for these 10 "
"people. However, if you think about it, this isn’t the best way to represent"
" these responses. Because of the fairly symmetric way that we set up the "
"response scale, there’s a sense in which the midpoint of the scale should "
"have been coded as 0 (no opinion), and the two endpoints should be **+3** "
"(strongly agree) and **-3** (strongly disagree). By recoding the data in "
"this way it’s a bit more reflective of how we really think about the "
"responses. The recoding here is pretty straightforward, we just subtract 4 "
"from the raw scores. In jamovi you can do this by computing a new variable: "
"click on the ``Compute`` button in the ``Data`` tab and you will see that a "
"new variable has been added to the spreadsheet. Let’s call this new variable"
" ``likert.centred`` (go ahead and type that in) and then add the following "
"in the formula box, like in :numref:`fig-likertraw`: ``likert.raw - 4``"

"One reason why it might be useful to have the data in this format is that "
"there are a lot of situations where you might prefer to analyse the "
"*strength* of the opinion separately from the *direction* of the opinion. We"
" can do two different transformations on this ``likert.centred`` variable in"
" order to distinguish between these two different concepts. First, to "
"compute an ``opinion.strength`` variable, we want to take the absolute value"
" of the centred data (using the ``ABS`` function).\\ [#]_ In jamovi, create "
"another new variable using the ``Compute`` button. Name the variable "
"``opinion.strength`` and this time click on the *f*\\ :sub:`x` button next "
"to the ``Formula`` box. This shows the different ``Functions`` and "
"``Variables`` that you can add to the ``Formula`` box, so double click on "
"``ABS`` and then double click on ``likert.centred`` and you will see that "
"the ``Formula`` box is populated with ``ABS(likert.centred)`` and a new "
"variable has been created in the spreadsheet view, as in :numref:`fig-"

"Second, to compute a variable that contains only the direction of the "
"opinion and ignores the strength, we want to calculate the ‘sign’ of the "

"Let’s break down what this ``IF`` command is doing. In jamovi there are "
"three parts to an ``IF`` statement, written as ``IF(expression, value, "
"else)``. The first part, ‘expression’ can be a logical or mathematical "
"statement. In our example, we have specified ``likert.centred == 0``, which "
"is ``TRUE`` for values where ``likert.centred`` is zero. The next part, "
"``value``, is the new value where the expression in part one is ``TRUE``. In"
" our example, we have said that for all those values where "
"``likert.centred`` is zero, keep them zero. In the next part, ``else``, we "
"can enter another logical or mathematical statement to be used if part one "
"evaluates to ``FALSE``, i.e. where ``likert.centred`` is not zero. In our "
"example we have divided ``likert.centred`` by opinion.strength to give "
"``-1`` or ``+1`` depending of the sign of the original value in "
"likert.centred.\\ [#]_"

"One pragmatic task that comes up quite often is the problem of collapsing a "

"people at a social gathering:"

"In some situations it can be quite helpful to group these into a smallish "
"number of categories. For example, we could group the data into three broad "
"categories: young (0-20), adult (21-40) and older (41-60). This is a quite "
"coarse-grained classification, and the labels that I’ve attached only make "
"sense in the context of this data set (e.g., viewed more generally, a 42 "
"year old wouldn’t consider themselves as “older”). We can slice this "
"variable up quite easily using the jamovi ``IF’ function that we have "
"already used. This time we have to specify nested ‘IF`` statements, meaning "
"simply that IF the first logical expression is TRUE, insert a first value, "
"but IF a second logical expression is TRUE, insert a second value, but IF a "
"third logical expression is TRUE, then insert a third value. This can be "
"written as:"

"It’s important to take the time to figure out whether or not the resulting "
"categories make any sense at all in terms of your research project. If they "
"don’t make any sense to you as meaningful categories, then any data analysis"
" that uses those categories is likely to be just as meaningless. More "
"generally, in practice I’ve noticed that people have a very strong desire to"
" carve their (continuous and messy) data into a few (discrete and simple) "
"categories, and then run analyses using the categorised data instead of the "
"original data.\\ [#]_ I wouldn’t go so far as to say that this is an "
"inherently bad idea, but it does have some fairly serious drawbacks at "
"times, so I would advise some caution if you are thinking about doing it."

"Sometimes you want to apply the same transformation to more than one "

" to multiple variables. Let’s go back to the first example above, using the "
"data file ``likert.omv`` that contains a single variable with raw Likert-"
"scale responses for 10 people. To create a transformation that you can save "
"and then apply across multiple variables (assuming you had more variables "
"like this in your data file), first in the spreadsheet editor select (i.e., "
"click) the variable you want to use to initially create the transformation. "

"You can also create a transformation with the second example we looked at, "
"the age distribution of people at a social gathering. Go on, you know you "
"want to! Remember that we collapsed this variable into three groups: "
"younger, adult and older. This time we will achieve the same thing, but "
"using the jamovi ``Transform`` → ``Add condition`` button. With this data "
"set (go back to it or create it again if you didn’t save it) set up a new "
"variable transformation. Call the transformed variable ``AgeCats`` and the "
"transformation you will create ``Agegroupings``. Then click on the big ``+``"

" unlikely you will have more than one ``Age`` variable, but you get the idea"
" now of how to set up transformations in jamovi, so you can follow this idea"
