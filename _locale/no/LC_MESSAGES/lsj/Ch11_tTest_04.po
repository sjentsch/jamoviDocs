"The biggest problem with using the Student test in practice is the third "
"assumption listed in the previous section. It assumes that both groups have "
"the same standard deviation. This is rarely true in real life. If two "
"samples don’t have the same means, why should we expect them to have the "
"same standard deviation? There’s really no reason to expect this assumption "
"to be true. We’ll talk a little bit about how you can check this assumption "
"later on because it does crop up in a few different places, not just the "
"*t*-test. But right now I’ll talk about a different form of the *t*-test "
"(`Welch, 1947 <References.html#welch-1947>`__\\ ) that does not rely on this"
" assumption. A graphical illustration of what the **Welch t test** assumes "
"about the data is shown in :numref:`fig-ttesthyp2`, to provide a contrast "
"with the Student test version in :numref:`fig-ttesthyp`. I’ll admit it’s a "
"bit odd to talk about the cure before talking about the diagnosis, but as it"
" happens the Welch test can be specified as one of the ‘Independent Samples "
"*t*-Test’ options in jamovi, so this is probably the best place to discuss "
"it."

" Welch t-test. Like the Student t-test for Independent Samples (:numref"

"The Welch test is very similar to the Student test. For example, the "

"The second difference between Welch and Student is that the degrees of "

"Except, except...our result isn’t significant anymore. When we ran the "
"Student test we did get a significant effect, but the Welch test on the same"
" data set is not (*t*\\(23.02) = 2.03, *p* = 0.054). What does this mean? "
"Should we panic? Is the sky burning? Probably not. The fact that one test is"
" significant and the other isn’t doesn’t itself mean very much, especially "
"since I kind of rigged the data so that this would happen. As a general "
"rule, it’s not a good idea to go out of your way to try to interpret or "
"explain the difference between a *p*-value of 0.049 and a *p*-value of "
"0.051. If this sort of thing happens in real life, the *difference* in these"
" *p*-values is almost certainly due to chance. What does matter is that you "
"take a little bit of care in thinking about what test you use. The Student "
"test and the Welch test have different strengths and weaknesses. If the two "
"populations really do have equal variances, then the Student test is "
"slightly more powerful (lower Type II error rate) than the Welch test. "
"However, if they *don’t* have the same variances, then the assumptions of "
"the Student test are violated and you may not be able to trust it; you might"
" end up with a higher Type I error rate. So it’s a trade off. However, in "
"real life I tend to prefer the Welch test, because almost no-one *actually* "
"believes that the population variances are identical."
