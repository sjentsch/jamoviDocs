"All statistical tests make assumptions, and it’s usually a good idea to "
"check that those assumptions are met. For the χ²-tests discussed so far in "

"*Expected frequencies are sufficiently large*. Remember how in the previous "
"section we saw that the χ² sampling distribution emerges because the "
"binomial distribution is pretty similar to a normal distribution? Well, like"
" we discussed in Chapter `Introduction to probability <Ch07_Probability.html"
"#introduction-to-probability>`__ this is only true when the number of "
"observations is sufficiently large. What that means in practice is that all "
"of the expected frequencies need to be reasonably big. How big is reasonably"
" big? Opinions differ, but the default assumption seems to be that you "
"generally would like to see all your expected frequencies larger than about "
"5, though for larger tables you would probably be okay if at least 80% of "
"the the expected frequencies are above 5 and none of them are below 1. "
"However, from what I’ve been able to discover (`Cochran, 1954 "
"<References.html#cochran-1954>`__\\ ), these seem to have been proposed as "
"rough guidelines, not hard and fast rules, and they seem to be somewhat "
"conservative (`Larntz, 1978 <References.html#larntz-1978>`__\\ )."

"*Data are independent of one another*. One somewhat hidden assumption of the"
" χ²-test is that you have to genuinely believe that the observations are "
"independent. Here’s what I mean. Suppose I’m interested in proportion of "
"babies born at a particular hospital that are boys. I walk around the "
"maternity wards and observe 20 girls and only 10 boys. Seems like a pretty "
"convincing difference, right? But later on, it turns out that I’d actually "
"walked into the same ward 10 times and in fact I’d only seen 2 girls and 1 "
"boy. Not as convincing, is it? My original 30 *observations* were massively "
"non-independent, and were only in fact equivalent to 3 independent "
"observations. Obviously this is an extreme (and extremely silly) example, "
"but it illustrates the basic issue. Non-independence “stuffs things up”. "
"Sometimes it causes you to falsely reject the null, as the silly hospital "
"example illustrates, but it can go the other way too. To give a slightly "
"less stupid example, let’s consider what would happen if I’d done the cards "
"experiment slightly differently Instead of asking 200 people to try to "
"imagine sampling one card at random, suppose I asked 50 people to select 4 "
"cards. One possibility would be that *everyone* selects one heart, one club,"
" one diamond and one spade (in keeping with the “representativeness "
"heuristic”; `Tversky & Kahneman, 1983 <References.html#tversky-1974>`__\\ )."
" This is highly non-random behaviour from people, but in this case I would "
"get an observed frequency of 50 for all four suits. For this example the "
"fact that the observations are non-independent (because the four cards that "
"you pick will be related to each other) actually leads to the opposite "
"effect, falsely retaining the null."

"If you happen to find yourself in a situation where independence is "
"violated, it may be possible to use the McNemar test (which we’ll discuss) "
"or the Cochran test (which we won’t). Similarly, if your expected cell "
"counts are too small, check out the Fisher exact test. It is to these topics"
" that we now turn."
