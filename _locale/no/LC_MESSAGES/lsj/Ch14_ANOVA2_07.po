"Each row in the table corresponds to one of the factor levels, and each "
"column corresponds to one of the contrasts. This table, which always has one"
" more row than columns, has a special name. It is called a **contrast "
"matrix**. However, there are lots of different ways to specify a contrast "
"matrix. In this section I discuss a few of the standard contrast matrices "
"that statisticians use and how you can use them in jamovi. If you’re "
"planning to read the section on unbalanced ANOVA later on (Section "
"`Factorial ANOVA 3: unbalanced designs <Ch14_ANOVA2_10.html#factorial-"
"anova-3-unbalanced-designs>`__), it’s worth reading this section carefully. "
"If not, you can get away with skimming it, because the choice of contrasts "
"doesn’t matter much for balanced designs."

"In the particular kind of contrasts that I’ve described above, one level of "
"the factor is special, and acts as a kind of “baseline” category (i.e., "
"``placebo`` in our example), against which the other two are defined. The "
"name for these kinds of contrasts is **treatment contrasts**, also known as "
"“dummy coding”. In this contrast each level of the factor is compared to a "
"base reference level, and the base reference level is the value of the "
"intercept."

"The name reflects the fact that these contrasts are quite natural and "
"sensible when one of the categories in your factor really is special because"
" it actually does represent a baseline. That makes sense in our clinical "
"trial example. The ``placebo`` condition corresponds to the situation where "
"you don’t give people any real drugs, and so it’s special. The other two "
"conditions are defined in relation to the placebo. In one case you replace "
"the placebo with Anxifree, and in the other case your replace it with "
"Joyzepam."

"In this example, the first contrast is level 2 compared with level 1, the "
"second contrast is level 3 compared with level 1, and so on. Notice that, by"
" default, the *first* level of the factor is always treated as the baseline "
"category (i.e., it’s the one that has all zeros and doesn’t have an explicit"
" contrast associated with it). In jamovi you can change which category is "
"the first level of the factor by manipulating the order of the levels of the"
" variable shown in the ‘Data Variable’ window (double click on the name of "

"Treatment contrasts are useful for a lot of situations. However, they make "
"most sense in the situation when there really is a baseline category, and "
"you want to assess all the other groups in relation to that one. In other "
"situations, however, no such baseline category exists, and it may make more "
"sense to compare each group to the mean of the other groups. This is where "
"we meet **Helmert contrasts**, generated by the ‘helmert’ option in the "
"jamovi ‘ANOVA’ - ‘Contrasts’ selection box. The idea behind Helmert "
"contrasts is to compare each group to the mean of the “previous” ones. That "
"is, the first contrast represents the difference between group 2 and group "
"1, the second contrast represents the difference between group 3 and the "
"mean of groups 1 and 2, and so on. This translates to a contrast matrix that"
" looks like this for a factor with five levels:"

"One useful thing about Helmert contrasts is that every contrast sums to zero"
" (i.e., all the columns sum to zero). This has the consequence that, when we"
" interpret the ANOVA as a regression, the intercept term corresponds to the "
"grand mean µ\\ :sub:`..` if we are using Helmert contrasts. Compare this to "
"treatment contrasts, in which the intercept term corresponds to the group "
"mean for the baseline category. This property can be very useful in some "
"situations. It doesn’t matter very much if you have a balanced design, which"
" we’ve been assuming so far, but it will turn out to be important later when"
" we consider unbalanced designs in Section `Factorial ANOVA 3: unbalanced "
"designs <Ch14_ANOVA2_10.html#factorial-anova-3-unbalanced-designs>`__. In "
"fact, the main reason why I’ve even bothered to include this section is that"
" contrasts become important if you want to understand unbalanced ANOVA."

"The third option that I should briefly mention are “sum to zero” contrasts, "
"called “Simple” contrasts in jamovi, which are used to construct pairwise "
"comparisons between groups. Specifically, each contrast encodes the "
"difference between one of the groups and a baseline category, which in this "
"case corresponds to the first group:"

"Much like Helmert contrasts, we see that each column sums to zero, which "
"means that the intercept term corresponds to the grand mean when ANOVA is "
"treated as a regression model. When interpreting these contrasts, the thing "
"to recognise is that each of these contrasts is a pairwise comparison "
"between group 1 and one of the other four groups. Specifically, contrast 1 "
"corresponds to a “group 2 minus group 1” comparison, contrast 2 corresponds "
"to a “group 3 minus group 1” comparison, and so on.\\ [#]_"
