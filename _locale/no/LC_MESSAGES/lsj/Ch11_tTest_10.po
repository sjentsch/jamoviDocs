"A `paired samples t-test <Ch11_tTest_05.html#the-paired-samples-t-test>`__ "
"is used when you have two scores from each person, and you want to test the "
"null hypothesis that the two scores have the same mean. It is equivalent to "
"taking the difference between the two scores for each person, and then "
"running a one sample *t*-test on the difference scores."
