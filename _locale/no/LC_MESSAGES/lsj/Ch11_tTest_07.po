"The most commonly used measure of effect size for a *t*-test is **Cohen’s "
"d** (`Cohen, 1988 <References.html#cohen-1988>`__\\ ). It’s a very simple "
"measure in principle, with quite a few wrinkles when you start digging into "
"the details. Cohen himself defined it primarily in the context of an "
"independent samples *t*-test, specifically the Student test. In that "
"context, a natural way of defining the effect size is to divide the "
"difference between the means by an estimate of the standard deviation. In "
"other words, we’re looking to calculate *something* along the lines of this:"

"and he suggested a rough guide for interpreting d in :numref:`tab-"
"cohensdinterpretation`. You’d think that this would be pretty unambiguous, "
"but it’s not. This is largely because Cohen wasn’t too specific on what he "
"thought should be used as the measure of the standard deviation (in his "
"defence he was trying to make a broader point in his book, not nitpick about"
" tiny details). As discussed by `McGrath and Meyer (2006) "
"<References.html#mcgrath-2006>`__, there are several different versions in "
"common usage, and each author tends to adopt slightly different notation. "
"For the sake of simplicity (as opposed to accuracy), I’ll use d to refer to "
"any statistic that you calculate from the sample, and use δ to refer to a "
"theoretical population effect. Obviously, that does mean that there are "
"several different things all called *d*."

"A (very) rough guide to interpreting Cohen’s *d*. My personal recommendation"
" is to not use these blindly. The d statistic has a natural interpretation "
"in and of itself. It re-describes the difference in means as the number of "
"standard deviations that separates those means. So it’s generally a good "
"idea to think about what that means in practical terms. In some contexts a "
"“small” effect could be of big practical importance. In other situations a "
"“large” effect may not be all that interesting."

"The majority of discussions of Cohen’s *d* focus on a situation that is "
"analogous to Student’s independent samples t test, and it’s in this context "
"that the story becomes messier, since there are several different versions "
"of *d* that you might want to use in this situation. To understand why there"
" are multiple versions of *d*, it helps to take the time to write down a "
"formula that corresponds to the true population effect size δ. It’s pretty "
"straightforward, δ = (*µ*\\ _sub:`1` - *µ*\\ _sub:`2`) /"

"to do exactly the same thing that we did in the *t*-test itself, i.e., use "

"However, there are other possibilities which I’ll briefly describe. Firstly,"
" you may have reason to want to use only one of the two groups as the basis "
"for calculating the standard deviation. This approach (often called Glass’ "
"*Δ*, pronounced *delta*) only makes most sense when you have good reason to "
"treat one of the two groups as a purer reflection of “natural variation” "
"than the other. This can happen if, for instance, one of the two groups is a"
" control group. Secondly, recall that in the usual calculation of the pooled"
" standard deviation we divide by *N* - 2 to correct for the bias in the "
"sample variance. In one version of Cohen’s *d* this correction is omitted, "
"and instead we divide by *N*. This version makes sense primarily when you’re"
" trying to calculate the effect size in the sample rather than estimating an"
" effect size in the population. Finally, there is a version based on `Hedges"
" and Olkin (1985) <References.html#hedges-1985>`__, who point out there is a"
" small bias in the usual (pooled) estimation for Cohen’s *d*. Thus they "
"introduce a small correction by multiplying the usual value of *d* by (*N* -"
" 3) / (*N* - 2.25)."
