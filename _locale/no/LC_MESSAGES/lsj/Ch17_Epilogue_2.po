"Statistics is a huge field. The core tools that I’ve described in this book "
"(χ²-tests, t-tests, regression and ANOVA) are basic tools that are widely "
"used in everyday data analysis, and they form the core of most introductory "
"stats books. However, there are a lot of other tools out there. There are so"
" very many data analysis situations that these tools don’t cover, and it "
"would be great to give you a sense of just how much more there is, for "
"example:"

"**Nonlinear regression.** When discussing regression in Chapter `Correlation"
" and linear regression <Ch12_Regression.html#correlation-and-linear-"
"regression>`__, we saw that regression assumes that the relationship between"
" predictors and outcomes is linear. On the other hand, when we talked about "
"the simpler problem of correlation, we saw that there exist tools (e.g., "
"Spearman correlations) that are able to assess non-linear relationships "
"between variables. There are a number of tools in statistics that can be "
"used to do non-linear regression. For instance, some non-linear regression "
"models assume that the relationship between predictors and outcomes is "
"monotonic (e.g., isotonic regression), while others assume that it is smooth"
" but not necessarily monotonic (e.g., Lowess regression), while others "
"assume that the relationship is of a known form that happens to be nonlinear"
" (e.g., polynomial regression)."

"**Logistic regression.** Yet another variation on regression occurs when the"
" outcome variable is binary, but the predictors are continuous. For "
"instance, suppose you’re investigating social media, and you want to know if"
" it’s possible to predict whether or not someone is on Twitter as a function"
" of their income, their age, and a range of other variables. This is "
"basically a regression model, but you can’t use regular linear regression "
"because the outcome variable is binary (you’re either on Twitter or you’re "
"not). Because the outcome variable is binary, there’s no way that the "
"residuals could possibly be normally distributed. There are a number of "
"tools that statisticians can apply to this situation, the most prominent of "
"which is logistic regression."

"**The General Linear Model (GLM).** The GLM is actually a family of models "
"that includes logistic regression, linear regression, (some) nonlinear "
"regression, ANOVA and many others. The basic idea in the GLM is essentially "
"the same idea that underpins linear models, but it allows for the idea that "
"your data might not be normally distributed, and allows for nonlinear "
"relationships between predictors and outcomes. There are a lot of very handy"
" analyses that you can run that fall within the GLM, so it’s a very useful "
"thing to know about."

"**Survival analysis.** In Chapter `A brief introduction to research design "
"<Ch02_StudyDesign.html>`__, I talked about “differential attrition”, the "
"tendency for people to leave the study in a non-random fashion. Back then, I"
" was talking about it as a potential methodological concern, but there are a"
" lot of situations in which differential attrition is actually the thing "
"you’re interested in. Suppose, for instance, you’re interested in finding "
"out how long people play different kinds of computer games in a single "
"session. Do people tend to play RTS (real time strategy) games for longer "
"stretches than FPS (first person shooter) games? You might design your study"
" like this. People come into the lab, and they can play for as long or as "
"little as they like. Once they’re finished, you record the time they spent "
"playing. However, due to ethical restrictions, let’s suppose that you cannot"
" allow them to keep playing longer than two hours. A lot of people will stop"
" playing before the two hour limit, so you know exactly how long they "
"played. But some people will run into the two hour limit, and so you don’t "
"know how long they would have kept playing if you’d been able to continue "
"the study. As a consequence, your data are systematically *censored*: you’re"
" missing all of the very long times. How do you analyse this data sensibly? "
"This is the problem that survival analysis solves. It is specifically "
"designed to handle this situation, where you’re systematically missing one "
"“side” of the data because the study ended. It’s very widely used in health "
"research, and in that context it is often literally used to analyse "
"survival. For instance, you may be tracking people with a particular type of"
" cancer, some who have received treatment A and others who have received "
"treatment B, but you only have funding to track them for 5 years. At the end"
" of the study period some people are alive, others are not. In this context,"
" survival analysis is useful for determining which treatment is more "
"effective, and telling you about the risk of death that people face over "
"time."

"**Mixed models.** Repeated measures ANOVA is often used in situations where "
"you have observations clustered within experimental units. A good example of"
" this is when you track individual people across multiple time points. Let’s"
" say you’re tracking happiness over time, for two people. Aaron’s happiness "
"starts at 10, then drops to 8, and then to 6. Belinda’s happiness starts at "
"6, then rises to 8 and then to 10. Both of these two people have the same "
"“overall” level of happiness (the average across the three time points is "
"8), so a repeated measures ANOVA analysis would treat Aaron and Belinda the "
"same way. But that’s clearly wrong. Aaron’s happiness is decreasing, whereas"
" Belinda’s is increasing. If you want to optimally analyse data from an "
"experiment where people can change over time, then you need a more powerful "
"tool than repeated measures ANOVA. The tools that people use to solve this "
"problem are called “mixed” models, because they are designed to learn about "
"individual experimental units (e.g. happiness of individual people over "
"time) as well as overall effects (e.g. the effect of money on happiness over"
" time). Repeated measures ANOVA is perhaps the simplest example of a mixed "
"model, but there’s a lot you can do with mixed models that you can’t do with"
" repeated measures ANOVA."

"**Multidimensional scaling.** Factor analysis is an example of an "
"“unsupervised learning” model. What this means is that, unlike most of the "
"“supervised learning” tools I’ve mentioned, you can’t divide up your "
"variables into predictors and outcomes. Regression is supervised learning "
"whereas factor analysis is unsupervised learning. It’s not the only type of "
"unsupervised learning model however. For example, in factor analysis one is "
"concerned with the analysis of correlations between variables. However, "
"there are many situations where you’re actually interested in analysing "
"similarities or dissimilarities between objects, items or people. There are "
"a number of tools that you can use in this situation, the best known of "
"which is multidimensional scaling (MDS). In MDS, the idea is to find a "
"“geometric” representation of your items. Each item is “plotted” as a point "
"in some space, and the distance between two points is a measure of how "
"dissimilar those items are."

"**Clustering.** Another example of an unsupervised learning model is "
"clustering (also referred to as classification), in which you want to "
"organise all of your items into meaningful groups, such that similar items "
"are assigned to the same groups. A lot of clustering is unsupervised, "
"meaning that you don’t know anything about what the groups are, you just "
"have to guess. There are other “supervised clustering” situations where you "
"need to predict group memberships on the basis of other variables, and those"
" group memberships are actually observables. Logistic regression is a good "
"example of a tool that works this way. However, when you don’t actually know"
" the group memberships, you have to use different tools (e.g., k-means "
"clustering). There are even situations where you want to do something called"
" “semi- supervised clustering”, in which you know the group memberships for "
"some items but not others. As you can probably guess, clustering is a pretty"
" big topic, and a pretty useful thing to know about."

"**Causal models.** One thing that I haven’t talked about much in this book "
"is how you can use statistical modelling to learn about the causal "
"relationships between variables. For instance, consider the following three "
"variables which might be of interest when thinking about how someone died in"
" a firing squad. We might want to measure whether or not an execution order "
"was given (variable A), whether or not a marksman fired their gun (variable "
"B), and whether or not the person got hit with a bullet (variable C). These "
"three variables are all correlated with one another (e.g., there is a "
"correlation between guns being fired and people getting hit with bullets), "
"but we actually want to make stronger statements about them than merely "
"talking about correlations. We want to talk about causation. We want to be "
"able to say that the execution order (A) causes the marksman to fire (B) "
"which causes someone to get shot (C). We can express this by a directed "
"arrow notation: we write it as A → B → C. This “causal chain” is a "
"fundamentally different explanation for events than one in which the "
"marksman fires first, which causes the shooting B → C, and then causes the "
"executioner to “retroactively” issue the execution order, B → A. This "
"“common effect” model says that A and C are both caused by B. You can see "
"why these are different. In the first causal model, if we had managed to "
"stop the executioner from issuing the order (intervening to change A), then "
"no shooting would have happened. In the second model, the shooting would "
"have happened any way because the marksman was *not* following the execution"
" order. There is a big literature in statistics on trying to understand the "
"causal relationships between variables, and a number of different tools "
"exist to help you test different causal stories about your data. The most "
"widely used of these tools (in psychology at least) is structural equations "
"modelling (SEM), and at some point I’d like to extend the book to talk about"
" it."

"Of course, even this listing is incomplete. I haven’t mentioned time series "
"analysis, item response theory, market basket analysis, classification and "
"regression trees, or any of a huge range of other topics. However, the list "
"that I’ve given above is essentially my wish list for this book. Sure, it "
"would double the length of the book, but it would mean that the scope has "
"become broad enough to cover most things that applied researchers in "
"psychology would need to use."
