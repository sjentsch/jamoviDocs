"Let’s begin with the humble **histogram**. Histograms are one of the "
"simplest and most useful ways of visualising data. They make most sense when"
" you have an interval or ratio scale variable (e.g., the ``afl.margins`` "
"data that we used in `Descriptive statistics <Ch04_Descriptives.html"
"#descriptive-statistics>`__ ) and what you want to do is get an overall "
"impression of the variable. Most of you probably know how histograms work, "
"since they’re so widely used, but for the sake of completeness I’ll describe"
" them. All you do is divide up the possible values into **bins** and then "
"count the number of observations that fall within each bin. This count is "
"referred to as the frequency or density of the bin and is displayed as a "
"vertical bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data there are 33 games in which the "
"winning margin was less than 10 points and it is this fact that is "
"represented by the height of the leftmost bar that we showed earlier in "
"`Descriptive statistics <Ch04_Descriptives.html#descriptive-statistics>`__, "
"and :numref:`fig-aflMargins`. With these earlier graphs we used an advanced "
"plotting package in R which, for now, is beyond the capability of jamovi. "
"But jamovi gets us close, and drawing this histogram in jamovi is pretty "
"straightforward. Open up the ``Plots`` options under ``Exploration`` → "
"``Descriptives`` and click the ``Histogram`` check box, as shown in :numref"
":`fig-jamovi_histogram`. jamovi defaults to labelling the y-axis as "
"‘density’ and the x-axis with the variable name. The **bins** are selected "
"automatically, and there is no scale, or count, information on the y-axis "
"unlike the previous :numref:`fig-aflMargins`. But this does not matter too "
"much because after all what we are really interested in is our impression of"
" the shape of the distribution: is it normally distributed or is there a "
"skew or kurtosis? Our first impressions of these characteristics come from "
"drawing a **histogram**."

"One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a density"
" curve. You can do this by clicking the ``Density`` check box under the "
"``Plots`` options (and unchecking ``Histogram``), and this gives us the plot"
" shown in :numref:`fig-histogram2`. A density plot visualises the "
"distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart "
"is a variation of a histogram that uses **kernel smoothing** to plot values,"
" allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The peaks "
"of a density plot help display where values are concentrated over the "
"interval. An advantage density plots have over histograms is that they are "
"better at determining the distribution shape because they’re not affected by"
" the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram). A histogram"
" comprising of only 4 bins wouldn’t produce a distinguishable enough shape "
"of distribution as a 20-bin histogram would. However, with density plots, "
"this isn’t an issue."

"Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a good "
"presentation graphic (i.e., one you’d include in a report), it nevertheless "
"does a pretty good job of describing the data. In fact, the big strength of "
"a histogram or density plot is that (properly used) it does show the entire "
"spread of the data, so you can get a pretty good sense about what it looks "
"like. The downside to histograms is that they aren’t very compact. Unlike "
"some of the other plots I’ll talk about it’s hard to cram 20-30 histograms "
"into a single image without overwhelming the viewer. And of course, if your "
"data are nominal scale then histograms are useless."
