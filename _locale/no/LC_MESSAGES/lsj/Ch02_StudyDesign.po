"*To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely"
" to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what "

"In this chapter, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas that go"
" into designing a study, collecting data, checking whether your data "
"collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough information to allow "
"you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of the basic "
"tools that you need to assess the studies done by other people. However, "
"since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than on data "
"collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note that this chapter is"
" “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more psychology-specific than the"
" later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific "
"problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of"
" data analysis. Nevertheless, the two problems are related to one another, "
"so it’s traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the problem in a little "
"detail. This chapter relies heavily on `Campbell and Stanley (1963) "
"<References.html#campbell-1963>`__ for the discussion of study design, and "
"`Stevens (1946) <References.html#stevens-1946>`__ for the discussion of "
"scales of measurement."
