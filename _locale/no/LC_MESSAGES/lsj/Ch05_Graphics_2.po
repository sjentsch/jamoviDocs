"Another alternative to histograms is a **box plot**, sometimes called a “box"
" and whiskers” plot. Like histograms they’re most suited to interval or "
"ratio scale data. The idea behind a box plot is to provide a simple visual "
"depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range of the data."
" And because they do so in a fairly compact way box plots have become a very"
" popular statistical graphic, especially during the exploratory stage of "
"data analysis when you’re trying to understand the data yourself. Let’s have"
" a look at how they work, again using the ``afl.margins`` data as our "
"example."

"The easiest way to describe what a box plot looks like is just to draw one. "
"Click on the ``Box plot`` check box and you will get the plot shown on the "
"lower right of :numref:`fig-boxplot1`. jamovi has drawn the most basic box "
"plot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you should interpret "
"it: the thick line in the middle of the box is the median; the box itself "
"spans the range from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile; and the "
"“whiskers” go out to the most extreme data point that doesn’t exceed a "
"certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times the interquartile range "
"(IQR), calculated as *25th percentile - (1.5 \\* IQR)* for the lower "
"boundary, and *75th percentile \\+ (1.5 \\* IQR)* for the upper boundary. "
"Any observation whose value falls outside this range is plotted as a circle "
"or dot instead of being covered by the whiskers, and is commonly referred to"
" as an **outlier**. For our AFL margins data there are two observations that"
" fall outside this range, and these observations are plotted as dots (the "
"upper boundary is 107, and looking over the data column in the spreadsheet "
"there are two observations with values higher than this, 108 and 116, so "
"these are the dots)."

msgid ""
"A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots are"
" similar to box plots except that they also show the kernel probability "
"density of the data at different values. Typically, violin plots will "
"include a marker for the median of the data and a box indicating the "
"interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi you can achieve "
"this sort of functionality by checking both the ``Violin`` and the ``Box "
"plot`` check boxes. See :numref:`fig-boxplot2`, which also has the ``Data`` "
"check box turned on to show the actual data points on the plot. This does "
"tend to make the graph a bit too busy though, in my opinion. Clarity is "
"simplicity, so in practice it might be better to just use a simple box plot."

"One last thing. What if you want to draw multiple box plots at once? "
"Suppose, for instance, I wanted separate box plots showing the AFL margins "
"not just for 2010 but for every year between 1987 and 2010. To do that the "
"first thing we``ll have to do is find the data. These are stored in the "
"``aflsmall2.csv`` file. So let’s load it into jamovi and see what is in it. "
"You will see that it is a pretty big data set. It contains 4296 games and "
"the variables that we’re interested in. What we want to do is have jamovi "
"draw box plots for the ``margin`` variable, but plotted separately for each "
"``year``. The way to do this is to move the ``year`` variable across into "
"the ``Split by`` box, as in :numref:`fig-splitfile1`."

"The result is shown in :numref:`fig-boxplot3`. This version of the box plot,"
" split by year, gives a sense of why it’s sometimes useful to choose box "
"plots instead of histograms. It’s possible to get a good sense of what the "
"data look like from year to year without getting overwhelmed with too much "
"detail. Now imagine what would have happened if I’d tried to cram 24 "
"histograms into this space: no chance at all that the reader is going to "
"learn anything useful."

"Because the box plot automatically separates out those observations that lie"
" outside a certain range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people often "
"use them as an informal method for detecting **outliers**: observations that"
" are “suspiciously” distant from the rest of the data. Here’s an example. "
"Suppose that I’d drawn the box plot for the AFL margins data and it came up "
"looking like :numref:`fig-boxplot4`."

"It’s pretty clear that something funny is going on with two of the "
"observations. Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was over "
"300 points! That doesn’t sound right to me. Now that I’ve become suspicious "
"it’s time to look a bit more closely at the data. In jamovi you can quickly "
"find out which of these observations are suspicious and then you can go back"
" to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake in data entry. To do "
"this you need to set up a filter so that only those observations with values"
" over a certain threshold are included. In our example, the threshold is "
"over 300, so that is the filter we will create. First, click on the "
"``Filters`` button at the top of the jamovi window, and then type ``margin >"
" 300`` into the filter field, as in :numref:`fig-filter1`."

"This filter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only those "
"observations that pass the filter are included. One neat way to quickly "
"identify which observations these are is to tell jamovi to produce a "
"``Frequency table`` (in the ``Exploration`` → ``Descriptives`` window) for "
"the ``ID`` variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise the "
"Frequency table is not produced). In :numref:`fig-filter2` you can see that "
"the ID values for the observations where the margin was over 300 are **14** "
"and **134**. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where you should "
"go back to the original data source to find out what is going on."

"Usually you find that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst "
"this might seem like a silly example, I should stress that this kind of "
"thing actually happens a lot. Real world data sets are often riddled with "
"stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something into a computer"
" at some point. In fact, there’s actually a name for this phase of data "
"analysis and in practice it can take up a huge chunk of our time: **data "
"cleaning**. It involves searching for typing mistakes (“typos”), missing "
"data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw data files."

"For less extreme values, even if they are flagged in a a box plot as "
"outliers, the decision about whether to include outliers or exclude them in "
"any analysis depends heavily on *why* you think the data look they way they "
"do and what you want to use the data *for*. You really need to exercise good"
" judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you, then keep it. In "
"any case, I’ll return to the topic again in Section `Model checking "
