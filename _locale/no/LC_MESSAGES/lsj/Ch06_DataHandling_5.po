"One very important kind of data handling is being able to extract a "
"particular subset of the data. For instance, you might be interested only in"
" analysing the data from one experimental condition, or you may want to look"
" closely at the data from people over 50 years in age. To do this, the first"
" step is getting jamovi to filter the subset of the data corresponding to "
"the observations that you’re interested in."

"This section returns to the ``nightgarden`` data set. If you’re reading this"
" whole chapter in one sitting, then you should already have this data set "
"loaded into a jamovi window. For this section, let’s focus on the two "
"variables ``speaker`` and ``utterance`` (see `Tabulating and cross-"
"tabulating data <Ch06_DataHandling_1.html#tabulating-and-cross-tabulating-"
"data>`__ if you’ve forgotten what those variables look like). Suppose that "
"what I want to do is pull out only those utterances that were made by "
"``makka-pakka``. To that end, we need to specify a filter in jamovi. First "
"open up a filter window by clicking on ``Filters`` on the main jamovi "
"``Data`` toolbar. Then, in the ``Filter 1`` text box, next to the ``=`` "
"sign, type the following:"

"When you have done this, you will see that a new column has been added to "
"the spreadsheet window (see :numref:`fig-subset1`), labelled ``Filter 1``, "
"with the cases where ``speaker`` is not ``makka-pakka`` greyed-out (i.e., "
"filtered out) and, conversely, the cases where ``speaker`` is ``makka-"
"pakka`` have a green check mark indicating they are filtered in. You can "
"test this by running ``Exploration`` → ``Descriptives``, assigning "
"``speaker`` to the ``Variables``- box and checking ``Frequency tables``. Go "
"on, try it, and see what that shows!"

"Following on from this simple example, you can also build up more complex "
"filters using logical expressions in jamovi. For instance, suppose I wanted "
"to keep only those cases when the utterance is either ``pip`` or ``oo``. In "
"this case in the ``Filter 1`` text box, next to the ``=`` sign, you would "
"type the following:"
