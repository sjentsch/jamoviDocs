"Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Let’s get started. Just as with any piece"
" of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a “computer”, which is a "
"magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or something "
"along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad marketing "
"campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you can download "
"it from the jamovi homepage, which is:"

"One way or another, regardless of what operating system you’re using, it’s "

"To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the results "

"It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet as "
"you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing data "
"sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi. Additionally, "
"you can easily import Excel, LibreOffice, SPSS, SAS, Stata and JASP files "
"directly into jamovi. To open a file select the File tab (three horizontal "
"lines; top left hand corner), select ``Open`` and then choose from the files"
" listed on ``Browse`` depending on whether you want to open an example or a "
"file stored on your computer."

"Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top. "
"Selecting an analysis will present an **options panel** for that particular "
"analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts of "

"When you have the analysis set up correctly you can dismiss the analysis "

"If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove it "

"Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesn’t usually make much of a "
