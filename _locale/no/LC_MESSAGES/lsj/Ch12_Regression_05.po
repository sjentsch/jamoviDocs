"The simple linear regression model that we’ve discussed up to this point "
"assumes that there’s a single predictor variable that you’re interested in, "
"in this case ``dan.sleep``. In fact, up to this point *every* statistical "
"tool that we’ve talked about has assumed that your analysis uses one "
"predictor variable and one outcome variable. However, in many (perhaps most)"
" research projects you actually have multiple predictors that you want to "
"examine. If so, it would be nice to be able to extend the linear regression "
"framework to be able to include multiple predictors. Perhaps some kind of "
"**multiple regression** model would be in order?"

"Multiple regression is conceptually very simple. All we do is add more terms"
" to our regression equation. Let’s suppose that we’ve got two variables that"
" we’re interested in; perhaps we want to use both ``dan.sleep`` and "
"``baby.sleep`` to predict the ``dan.grump`` variable. As before, we let "
"*Y*\\ :sub:`i` refer to my grumpiness on the i-th day. But now we have two "
"*X* variables: the first corresponding to the amount of sleep I got and the "
"second corresponding to the amount of sleep my son got. So we’ll let *X*\\ "
":sub:`i1` refer to the hours I slept on the i-th day and *X*\\ :sub:`i2` "
"refers to the hours that the baby slept on that day. If so, then we can "
"write our regression model like this:"

"As before, ε\\ :sub:`i` is the residual associated with the i-th "
"observation, ε\\ :sub:`i` = {Y}_i - \\hat{Y}_i`. In this model, we now have "
"three coefficients that need to be estimated: *b*\\ :sub:`0` is the "
"intercept, *b*\\ :sub:`1` is the coefficient associated with my sleep, and "
"*b*\\ :sub:`2` is the coefficient associated with my son’s sleep. However, "
"although the number of coefficients that need to be estimated has changed, "
"the basic idea of how the estimation works is unchanged: our estimated "
"coefficients :math:`\\hat{b}_0`, :math:`\\hat{b}_1` and :math:`\\hat{b}_2` "
"are those that minimise the sum squared residuals."

"Multiple regression in jamovi is no different to simple regression. All we "
"have to do is add additional variables to the ``Covariates`` box in jamovi. "
"For example, if we want to use both ``dan.sleep`` and ``baby.sleep`` as "
"predictors in our attempt to explain why I’m so grumpy, then move "
"``baby.sleep`` across into the ``Covariates`` box alongside ``dan.sleep``. "
"By default, jamovi assumes that the model should include an intercept. The "
"coefficients we get this time are:"

"The coefficient associated with ``dan.sleep`` is quite large, suggesting "
"that every hour of sleep I lose makes me a lot grumpier. However, the "
"coefficient for ``baby.sleep`` is very small, suggesting that it doesn’t "
"really matter how much sleep my son gets. What matters as far as my "
"grumpiness goes is how much sleep *I* get. To get a sense of what this "
"multiple regression model looks like, :numref:`fig-scatter3d_1` shows a 3D "
"plot that plots all three variables, along with the regression model itself."

"3D visualisation of a multiple regression model: There are two predictors in"
" the model, ``dan.sleep`` and ``baby.sleep`` and the outcome variable is "
"``dan.grump``. Together, these three variables form a 3D space. Each "
"observation (dot) is a point in this space. In much the same way that a "
"simple linear regression model forms a line in 2D space, this multiple "
"regression model forms a plane in 3D space. When we estimate the regression "
"coefficients what we’re trying to do is find a plane that is as close to all"
" the blue dots as possible."

"The equation that I gave above shows you what a multiple regression model "
"looks like when you include two predictors. Not surprisingly, then, if you "
"want more than two predictors all you have to do is add more *X* terms and "
"more *b* coefficients. In other words, if you have K predictor variables in "
"the model then the regression equation looks like this"
