"Suppose you’ve been hired to work for the *Australian Generic Political "
"Party* (AGPP), and part of your job is to find out how effective the AGPP "
"political advertisements are. So you decide to put together a sample of N = "
"100 people and ask them to watch the AGPP ads. Before they see anything, you"
" ask them if they intend to vote for the AGPP, and then after showing the "
"ads you ask them again to see if anyone has changed their minds. Obviously, "

"At first pass, you might think that this situation lends itself to the "
"Pearson `χ² test of independence <Ch10_ChiSquare_2.html#the-2-chi-square-"
"test-of-independence-or-association>`__. However, a little bit of thought "
"reveals that we’ve got a problem. We have 100 participants but 200 "
"observations. This is because each person has provided us with an answer in "
"*both* the before column and the after column. What this means is that the "
"200 observations aren’t independent of each other. If voter A says “yes” the"
" first time and voter B says “no”, then you’d expect that voter A is more "
"likely to say “yes” the second time than voter B! The consequence of this is"
" that the usual χ² test won’t give trustworthy answers due to the violation "
"of the independence assumption. Now, if this were a really uncommon "
"situation, I wouldn’t be bothering to waste your time talking about it. But "
"it’s not uncommon at all. This is a *standard* repeated measures design, and"
" none of the tests we’ve considered so far can handle it. Eek."

"Next, let’s think about what our null hypothesis is: it’s that the “before” "
"test and the “after” test have the same proportion of people saying “Yes, I "
"will vote for AGPP”. Because of the way that we have rewritten the data, it "
"means that we’re now testing the hypothesis that the *row totals* and "
"*column totals* come from the same distribution. Thus, the null hypothesis "
"in McNemar’s test is that we have “marginal homogeneity”. That is, the row "
"totals and column totals have the same distribution: *P*\\ :sub:`a` + *P*\\ "
":sub:`b` = *P*\\ :sub:`a` \\+ *P*\\ :sub:`c` and similarly that *P*\\ "
":sub:`c` + *P*\\ :sub:`d` = *P*\\ :sub:`b` + *P*\\ :sub:`d`\\. Notice that "
"this means that the null hypothesis actually simplifies to *P*\\ :sub:`b` = "
"*P*\\ :sub:`c`\\. In other words, as far as the McNemar test is concerned, "
"it’s only the off-diagonal entries in this table (i.e., *b* and *c*) that "
"matter! After noticing this, the **McNemar test of marginal homogeneity** is"
" no different to a usual χ² test. After applying the Yates correction, our "
"test statistic becomes:"

"``Analyses`` → ``Frequencies`` → ``Contingency Tables`` → ``Paired Samples``"
" in jamovi, and move ``response_before`` into the ``Rows`` box, and "
