"A variation in ANOVA is when you have an additional continuous variable that"
" you think might be related to the dependent variable. This additional "
"variable can be added to the analysis as a covariate, in the aptly named "
"analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)."

"In ANCOVA the values of the dependent variable are “adjusted” for the "
"influence of the covariate, and then the “adjusted” score means are tested "
"between groups in the usual way. This technique can increase the precision "
"of an experiment, and therefore provide a more “powerful” test of the "
"equality of group means in the dependent variable. How does ANCOVA do this? "
"Well, although the covariate itself is typically not of any experimental "
"interest, adjustment for the covariate can decrease the estimate of "
"experimental error and thus, by reducing error variance, precision is "
"increased. This means that an inappropriate failure to reject the null "
"hypothesis (false negative or type II error) is less likely."

"Despite this advantage, ANCOVA runs the risk of undoing real differences "
"between groups, and this should be avoided. Look at :numref:`fig-"
"ancova_groups`, for example, which shows a plot of Statistics anxiety "
"against age and shows two distinct groups – students who have either an Arts"
" or Science background or preference. ANCOVA with age as a covariate might "
"lead to the conclusion that statistics anxiety does not differ in the two "
"groups. Would this conclusion be reasonable – probably not because the ages "
"of the two groups do not overlap and analysis of variance has essentially "
"“extrapolated into a region with no data” (`Everitt, 1996 "
"<References.html#everitt-1996>`__\\ )."

"Clearly, careful thought needs to be given to an analysis of covariance with"

"A health psychologist was interested in the effect of routine cycling and "

"undertake an ANCOVA, select ``Analyses`` → ``ANOVA`` → ``ANCOVA`` to open "
"the ANCOVA analysis window (:numref:`fig-ancova1`). Highlight the dependent "
"variable ``happiness`` and transfer it into the ``Dependent Variable`` text "
"box. Highlight the independent variables ``stress`` and ``commute`` and "
"transfer them into the ``Fixed Factors`` text box. Highlight the covariate "
"``age`` and transfer it into the ``Covariates`` text box. Then Click on "
"``Estimated Marginal Means`` to bring up the plots and tables options."

"An ANCOVA table showing Tests of Between-Subjects Effects is produced in the"
" jamovi results panel (:numref:`fig-ancova2`). The F value for the covariate"
" ``age`` is significant at *p* = 0.023, suggesting that age is an important "
"predictor of the dependent variable, happiness. When we look at the "
"estimated marginal mean scores (:numref:`fig-ancova3`), adjustments have "
"been made (compared to an analysis without the covariate) because of the "
"inclusion of the covariate ‘age’ in this ANCOVA. A plot (:numref:`fig-"
"ancova4`) is a good way of visualising and interpreting the significant "
"effects."

"One thing to be aware of is that, if you are thinking of including a "
"covariate in your ANOVA, there is an additional assumption: the relationship"
" between the covariate and the dependent variable should be similar for all "
"levels of the independent variable. This can be checked by adding an "
"interaction term between the covariate and each independent variable in the "
"jamovi ``Model - Model terms`` option. If the interaction effect is not "
"significant it can be removed. If it is significant then a different and "
"more advanced statistical technique might be appropriate (which is beyond "
"the scope of this book so you might want to consult a friendly "
"statistician)."
