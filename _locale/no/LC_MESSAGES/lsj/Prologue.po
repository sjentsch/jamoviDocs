"*learning statistics with jamovi* covers the contents of an introductory "
"statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students. "
"It is part of the jamovi documentation but also available `as a textbook "
"<https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__. It discusses how to get started "
"in jamovi as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation. From a "
"statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and "
"graphing first, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and "
"estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the "
"book covers the analysis of contingency tables, correlation, t-tests, "
"regression, ANOVA and factor analysis. Bayesian statistics are covered at "
"the end of the book."

"This update from version 0.65 introduces some new analyses. In the ANOVA "
"chapters we have added sections on repeated measures ANOVA and analysis of "
"covariance (ANCOVA). In a new chapter we have introduced Factor Analysis and"
" related techniques. Hopefully the style of this new material is consistent "
"with the rest of the book, though eagle-eyed readers might spot a bit more "
"of an emphasis on conceptual and practical explanations, and a bit less "
"algebra. I’m not sure this is a good thing, and might add the algebra in a "
"bit later. But it reflects both my approach to understanding and teaching "
"statistics, and also some feedback I have received from students on a course"
" I teach. In line with this, I have also been through the rest of the book "
"and tried to separate out some of the algebra by putting it into a box or "
"frame. It’s not that this stuff is not important or useful, but for some "
"students they may wish to skip over it and therefore the boxing of these "
"parts should help some readers."

"In this adaptation of the excellent “Learning statistics with R”, by "
"Danielle Navarro, we have replaced the statistical software used for the "
"analyses and examples with jamovi. Although R is a powerful statistical "
"programming language, it is not the first choice for every instructor and "
"student at the beginning of their statistical learning. Some instructors and"
" students tend to prefer the point-and-click style of software, and that’s "
"where jamovi comes in. jamovi is software that aims to simplify two aspects "
"of using R. It offers a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), and "
"it also provides functions that combine the capabilities of many others, "
"bringing a more SPSS- or SAS-like method of programming to R. Importantly, "
"jamovi will always be free and open - that’s one of its core values - "
"because jamovi is made by the scientific community, for the scientific "
"community."

"The book hasn’t changed much since 2015 when I released Version 0.5 – it’s "

"Another year, another update. This time around, the update has focused "
"almost entirely on the theory sections of the book. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 "
"have been rewritten, hopefully for the better. Along the same lines, Chapter"
" 17 is entirely new, and focuses on Bayesian statistics. I think the changes"
" have improved the book a great deal. I’ve always felt uncomfortable about "
"the fact that all the inferential statistics in the book are presented from "
"an orthodox perspective, even though I almost always present Bayesian data "
"analyses in my own work. Now that I’ve managed to squeeze Bayesian methods "
"into the book somewhere, I’m starting to feel better about the book as a "
"whole. I wanted to get a few other things done in this update, but as usual "
"I’m running into teaching deadlines, so the update has to go out the way it "

"A year has gone by since I wrote the last preface. The book has changed in a"

"What this means is that if you are an academic looking for teaching "

"commercial publisher told me it would retail for when they offered to "
"distribute it) makes me feel more than a little uncomfortable. However, it’s"
" the 21st century, so I can post the pdf on my website for free, and I can "
"distribute hard copies via a print-on-demand service for less than half what"
" a textbook publisher would charge. And so my guilt is assuaged, and I’m "
"willing to share! With that in mind, you can obtain free soft copies and "
"cheap hard copies online, from the following webpages:"

"All of the above being said, there is one group of people that I can "
"enthusiastically endorse this book to: the psychology students taking our "
"undergraduate research methods classes (DRIP and DRIP:A) in 2013. For you, "
"this book is ideal, because it was written to accompany your stats lectures."
" If a problem arises due to a shortcoming of these notes, I can and will "
"adapt content on the fly to fix that problem. Effectively, you’ve got a "
"textbook written specifically for your classes, distributed for free "
"(electronic copy) or at near-cost prices (hard copy). Better yet, the notes "
"have been tested: Version 0.1 of these notes was used in the 2011 class, "
"Version 0.2 was used in the 2012 class, and now you’re looking at the new "
"and improved Version 0.3. I’[for a historical summary]m not saying these "
"notes are titanium plated awesomeness on a stick – though if *you* wanted to"
" say so on the student evaluation forms, then you’re totally welcome to – "
"because they’re not. But I am saying that they’ve been tried out in previous"
" years and they seem to work okay. Besides, there’s a group of us around to "
"troubleshoot if any problems come up, and you can guarantee that at least "
"*one* of your lecturers has read the whole thing cover to cover!"

"Okay, with all that out of the way, I should say something about what the "
"book aims to be. At its core, it is an introductory statistics textbook "
"pitched primarily at psychology students. As such, it covers the standard "
"topics that you’d expect of such a book: study design, descriptive "
"statistics, the theory of hypothesis testing, t-tests, χ²-tests, ANOVA and "
"regression. However, there are also several chapters devoted to the R "
"statistical package, including a chapter on data manipulation and another "
"one on scripts and programming. Moreover, when you look at the content "
"presented in the book, you’ll notice a lot of topics that are traditionally "
"swept under the carpet when teaching statistics to psychology students. The "
"Bayesian / frequentist divide is openly disussed in the probability chapter,"
" and the disagreement between Neyman and Fisher about hypothesis testing "
"makes an appearance. The difference between probability and density is "
"discussed. A detailed treatment of Type I, II and III sums of squares for "
"unbalanced factorial ANOVA is provided. And if you have a look in the "
"Epilogue, it should be clear that my intention is to add a lot more advanced"
" content."

"My reasons for pursuing this approach are pretty simple: the students can "
"handle it, and they even seem to enjoy it. Over the last few years I’ve been"
" pleasantly surprised at just how little difficulty I’ve had in getting "
"undergraduate psych students to learn R. It’s certainly not easy for them, "
"and I’ve found I need to be a little charitable in setting marking "
"standards, but they do eventually get there. Similarly, they don’t seem to "
"have a lot of problems tolerating ambiguity and complexity in presentation "
"of statistical ideas, as long as they are assured that the assessment "
"standards will be set in a fashion that is appropriate for them. So if the "
"students can handle it, why *not* teach it? The potential gains are pretty "
"enticing. If they learn R, the students get access to CRAN, which is perhaps"
" the largest and most comprehensive library of statistical tools in "
"existence. And if they learn about probability theory in detail, it’s easier"
" for them to switch from orthodox null hypothesis testing to Bayesian "
"methods if they want to. Better yet, they learn data analysis skills that "
"they can take to an employer without being dependent on expensive and "
"proprietary software."

" provide a basic introduction to statistics using R, and I’m not arrogant "
"enough to believe that mine is better. Still, I rather like the book, and "
