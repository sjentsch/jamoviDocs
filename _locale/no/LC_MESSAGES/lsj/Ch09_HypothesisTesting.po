"*The process of induction is the process of assuming the simplest law that "
"can be made to harmonize with our experience. This process, however, has no "
"logical foundation but only a psychological one. It is clear that there are "
"no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really "
"happen. It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and this means "
"that we do not know whether it will rise.*"

"In the last chapter I discussed the ideas behind estimation, which is one of"
" the two “big ideas” in inferential statistics. It’s now time to turn our "
"attention to the other big idea, which is *hypothesis testing*. In its most "
"abstract form, hypothesis testing is really a very simple idea. The "
"researcher has some theory about the world and wants to determine whether or"
" not the data actually support that theory. However, the details are messy "
"and most people find the theory of hypothesis testing to be the most "
"frustrating part of statistics. The structure of the chapter is as follows. "
"First, I’ll describe how hypothesis testing works in a fair amount of "
"detail, using a simple running example to show you how a hypothesis test is "
"“built”. I’ll try to avoid being too dogmatic while doing so, and focus "
"instead on the underlying logic of the testing procedure.\\ [#]_ Afterwards,"
" I’ll spend a bit of time talking about the various dogmas, rules and "
"heresies that surround the theory of hypothesis testing."

"A technical note. The description below differs subtly from the standard "
"description given in a lot of introductory texts. The orthodox theory of "
"null hypothesis testing emerged from the work of Sir Ronald Fisher and Jerzy"
" Neyman in the early 20th century; but Fisher and Neyman actually had very "
"different views about how it should work. The standard treatment of "
"hypothesis testing that most texts use is a hybrid of the two approaches. "
"The treatment here is a little more Neyman-style than the orthodox view, "
"especially as regards the meaning of the *p* value."
