"Suppose my friend is putting together a new questionnaire intended to "
"measure “grumpiness”. The survey has 50 questions which you can answer in a "
"grumpy way or not. Across a big sample (hypothetically, let’s imagine a "
"million people or so!) the data are fairly normally distributed, with the "
"mean grumpiness score being 17 out of 50 questions answered in a grumpy way,"
" and the standard deviation is 5. In contrast, when I take the questionnaire"
" I answer 35 out of 50 questions in a grumpy way. So, how grumpy am I? One "
"way to think about it would be to say that I have grumpiness of 35/50, so "
"you might say that I’m 70% grumpy. But that’s a bit weird, when you think "
"about it. If my friend had phrased her questions a bit differently people "
"might have answered them in a different way, so the overall distribution of "
"answers could easily move up or down depending on the precise way in which "
"the questions were asked. So, I’m only 70% grumpy *with respect to this set "
"of survey questions*. Even if it’s a very good questionnaire this isn’t very"
" a informative statement."

"A simpler way around this is to describe my grumpiness by comparing me to "
"other people. Shockingly, out of my friend’s sample of 1,000,000 people, "
"only 159 people were as grumpy as me (that’s not at all unrealistic, "
"frankly) suggesting that I’m in the top 0.016% of people for grumpiness. "
"This makes much more sense than trying to interpret the raw data. This idea,"
" that we should describe my grumpiness in terms of the overall distribution "
"of the grumpiness of humans, is the qualitative idea that standardisation "
"attempts to get at. One way to do this is to do exactly what I just did and "
"describe everything in terms of percentiles. However, the problem with doing"
" this is that “it’s lonely at the top”. Suppose that my friend had only "
"collected a sample of 1000 people (still a pretty big sample for the "
"purposes of testing a new questionnaire, I’d like to add), and this time "
"gotten, let’s say, a mean of 16 out of 50 with a standard deviation of 5. "
"The problem is that almost certainly not a single person in that sample "
"would be as grumpy as me."

"However, all is not lost. A different approach is to convert my grumpiness "
"score into a **standard score**, also referred to as a *z*-score. The "
"standard score is defined as the number of standard deviations above the "
"mean that my grumpiness score lies. To phrase it in “pseudo-maths” the "
"standard score is calculated like this:"

"To interpret this value, recall the rough heuristic that I provided in "
"Section `Standard deviation <Ch04_Descriptives_2.html#standard-deviation>`__"
" in which I noted that 99.7% of values are expected to lie within 3 standard"
" deviations of the mean. So the fact that my grumpiness corresponds to a *z*"
" score of 3.6 indicates that I’m very grumpy indeed. In fact this suggests "
"that I’m grumpier than 99.98% of people. Sounds about right."

"In addition to allowing you to interpret a raw score in relation to a larger"
" population (and thereby allowing you to make sense of variables that lie on"
" arbitrary scales), standard scores serve a second useful function. Standard"
" scores can be compared to one another in situations where the raw scores "
"can’t. Suppose, for instance, my friend also had another questionnaire that "
"measured extraversion using a 24 item questionnaire. The overall mean for "
"this measure turns out to be 13 with standard deviation 4, and I scored a 2."
" As you can imagine, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to try to compare my raw"
" score of 2 on the extraversion questionnaire to my raw score of 35 on the "
"grumpiness questionnaire. The raw scores for the two variables are “about” "
"fundamentally different things, so this would be like comparing apples to "
"oranges."

"What about the standard scores? Well, this is a little different. If we "
"calculate the standard scores we get *z* = (35 - 17) / 5 = 3.6 for "
"grumpiness and *z* = (2 - 13) / 4 = -2.75 for extraversion. These two "
"numbers *can* be compared to each other.\\ [#]_ I’m much less extraverted "
"than most people (*z* = -2.75) and much grumpier than most people (*z* = "
"\\3.6). But the extent of my unusualness is much more extreme for "
"grumpiness, since 3.6 is a bigger number than 2.75. Because each "
"standardised score is a statement about where an observation falls *relative"
" to its own population*, it is possible to compare standardised scores "
"across completely different variables."

"Though some caution is usually warranted. It’s not always the case that one "
"standard deviation on variable A corresponds to the same “kind” of thing as "
"one standard deviation on variable B. Use common sense when trying to "
"determine whether or not the *z* scores of two variables can be meaningfully"
" compared."
