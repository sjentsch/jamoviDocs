"Before we start talking about probability theory, it’s helpful to spend a "
"moment thinking about the relationship between probability and statistics. "
"The two disciplines are closely related but they’re not identical. "
"Probability theory is “the doctrine of chances”. It’s a branch of "
"mathematics that tells you how often different kinds of events will happen. "
"For example, all of these questions are things you can answer using "
"probability theory:"

"Notice that all of these questions have something in common. In each case "
"the “truth of the world” is known and my question relates to the “what kind "
"of events” will happen. In the first question I *know* that the coin is fair"
" so there’s a 50% chance that any individual coin flip will come up heads. "
"In the second question I *know* that the chance of rolling a 6 on a single "
"die is 1 in 6. In the third question I *know* that the deck is shuffled "
"properly. And in the fourth question I *know* that the lottery follows "
"specific rules. You get the idea. The critical point is that probabilistic "
"questions start with a known **model** of the world, and we use that model "
"to do some calculations. The underlying model can be quite simple. For "
"instance, in the coin flipping example we can write down the model like "
"this:"

"which you can read as “the probability of heads is 0.5”. As we’ll see later,"
" in the same way that percentages are numbers that range from 0% to 100%, "
"probabilities are just numbers that range from 0 to 1. When using this "
"probability model to answer the first question I don’t actually know exactly"
" what’s going to happen. Maybe I’ll get 10 heads, like the question says. "
"But maybe I’ll get three heads. That’s the key thing. In probability theory "
"the *model* is known but the *data* are not."

"So that’s probability. What about statistics? Statistical questions work the"
" other way around. In statistics we do not know the truth about the world. "
"All we have is the data and it is from the data that we want to *learn* the "
"truth about the world. Statistical questions tend to look more like these:"

"This time around the only thing we have are data. What I *know* is that I "
"saw my friend flip the coin 10 times and it came up heads every time. And "
"what I want to **infer** is whether or not I should conclude that what I "
"just saw was actually a fair coin being flipped 10 times in a row, or "
"whether I should suspect that my friend is playing a trick on me. The data I"
" have look like this:"

"and what I’m trying to do is work out which “model of the world” I should "
"put my trust in. If the coin is fair then the model I should adopt is one "
"that says that the probability of heads is 0.5, that is *P*\\ (heads) = "
"*0.5*. If the coin is not fair then I should conclude that the probability "
"of heads is *not* 0.5, which we would write as *P*\\ (heads) ≠ *0.5*. In "
"other words, the statistical inference problem is to figure out which of "
"these probability models is right. Clearly, the statistical question isn’t "
"the same as the probability question, but they’re deeply connected to one "
"another. Because of this, a good introduction to statistical theory will "
"start with a discussion of what probability is and how it works."
