"Let’s start with the first of these questions. What is “probability”? It "
"might seem surprising to you but while statisticians and mathematicians "
"(mostly) agree on what the *rules* of probability are, there’s much less of "
"a consensus on what the word really *means*. It seems weird because we’re "
"all very comfortable using words like “chance”, “likely”, “possible” and "
"“probable”, and it doesn’t seem like it should be a very difficult question "
"to answer. But if you’ve ever had that experience in real life you might "
"walk away from the conversation feeling like you didn’t quite get it right, "
"and that (like many everyday concepts) it turns out that you don’t *really* "
"know what it’s all about."

"Notice that at the start of the sequence the *proportion* of heads "
"fluctuates wildly, starting at 0.00 and rising as high as 0.80. Later on, "
"one gets the impression that it dampens out a bit, with more and more of the"
" values actually being pretty close to the “right” answer of 0.50. This is "
"the frequentist definition of probability in a nutshell. Flip a fair coin "
"over and over again, and as *N* grows large (approaches infinity, denoted "
"*N* → ∞) the proportion of heads will converge to 50%. There are some subtle"
" technicalities that the mathematicians care about, but qualitatively "
"speaking that’s how the frequentists define probability. Unfortunately, I "
"don’t have an infinite number of coins or the infinite patience required to "
"flip a coin an infinite number of times. However, I do have a computer and "
"computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks. So I asked my computer to "
"simulate flipping a coin 1000 times and then drew a picture of what happens "
"to the proportion *N*\\ :sub:`H` / *N* as *N* increases. Actually, I did it "
"four times just to make sure it wasn’t a fluke. The results are shown in "
":numref:`fig-frequentistProb`. As you can see, the *proportion of observed "
"heads* eventually stops fluctuating and settles down. When it does, the "
"number at which it finally settles is the true probability of heads."

"The frequentist definition of probability has some desirable "
"characteristics. First, it is objective. The probability of an event is "
"*necessarily* grounded in the world. The only way that probability "
"statements can make sense is if they refer to (a sequence of) events that "
"occur in the physical universe.\\ [#]_ Secondly, it is unambiguous. Any two "
"people watching the same sequence of events unfold, trying to calculate the "
"probability of an event, must inevitably come up with the same answer."

"However, it also has undesirable characteristics. First, infinite sequences "
"don’t exist in the physical world. Suppose you picked up a coin from your "
"pocket and started to flip it. Every time it lands it impacts on the ground."
" Each impact wears the coin down a bit. Eventually the coin will be "
"destroyed. So, one might ask whether it really makes sense to pretend that "
"an “infinite” sequence of coin flips is even a meaningful concept, or an "
"objective one. We can’t say that an “infinite sequence” of events is a real "
"thing in the physical universe, because the physical universe doesn’t allow "
"infinite anything. More seriously, the frequentist definition has a narrow "
"scope. There are lots of things out there that human beings are happy to "
"assign probability to in everyday language, but cannot (even in theory) be "
"mapped onto a hypothetical sequence of events. For instance, if a "
"meteorologist comes on TV and says “the probability of rain in Adelaide on 2"
" November 2048 is 60%” we humans are happy to accept this. But it’s not "
"clear how to define this in frequentist terms. There’s only one city of "
"Adelaide, and only one 2 November 2048. There’s no infinite sequence of "
"events here, just a one-off thing. Frequentist probability genuinely "
"*forbids* us from making probability statements about a single event. From "
"the frequentist perspective it will either rain tomorrow or it will not. "
"There is no “probability” that attaches to a single non-repeatable event. "
"Now, it should be said that there are some very clever tricks that "
"frequentists can use to get around this. One possibility is that what the "
"meteorologist means is something like “There is a category of days for which"
" I predict a 60% chance of rain, and if we look only across those days for "
"which I make this prediction, then on 60% of those days it will actually "
"rain”. It’s very weird and counterintuitive to think of it this way, but you"
" do see frequentists do this sometimes. And it *will* come up later in this "
"book (see `Estimating a confidence interval "
"<Ch08_Estimation_5.html#estimating-a-confidence-interval>`__)."

msgid ""
"The **Bayesian view** of probability is often called the subjectivist view, "
"and although it has been a minority view among statisticians it has been "
"steadily gaining traction for the last several decades. There are many "
"flavours of Bayesianism, making it hard to say exactly what “the” Bayesian "
"view is. The most common way of thinking about subjective probability is to "
"define the probability of an event as the **degree of belief** that an "
"intelligent and rational agent assigns to that truth of that event. From "
"that perspective, probabilities don’t exist in the world but rather in the "
"thoughts and assumptions of people and other intelligent beings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../lsj/Ch07_Probability_2.rst:165
msgid ""
"However, in order for this approach to work we need some way of "
"operationalising “degree of belief”. One way that you can do this is to "
"formalise it in terms of “rational gambling”, though there are many other "
"ways. Suppose that I believe that there’s a 60% probability of rain "
"tomorrow. If someone offers me a bet that if it rains tomorrow then I win "
"$5, but if it doesn’t rain I lose $5. Clearly, from my perspective, this is "
"a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if I think that the probability of "
"rain is only 40% then it’s a bad bet to take. So we can operationalise the "
"notion of a “subjective probability” in terms of what bets I’m willing to "
"accept."

"What are the advantages and disadvantages to the Bayesian approach? The main"
" advantage is that it allows you to assign probabilities to any event you "
"want to. You don’t need to be limited to those events that are repeatable. "
"The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we can’t be purely objective."
" Specifying a probability requires us to specify an entity that has the "
"relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a human, an alien, a robot, "
"or even a statistician. But there has to be an intelligent agent out there "
"that believes in things. To many people this is uncomfortable, it seems to "
"make probability arbitrary. Whilst the Bayesian approach requires that the "
"agent in question be rational (i.e., obey the rules of probability), it does"
" allow everyone to have their own beliefs. I can believe the coin is fair "
"and you don’t have to, even though we’re both rational. The frequentist view"
" doesn’t allow any two observers to attribute different probabilities to the"
" same event. When that happens then at least one of them must be wrong. The "
"Bayesian view does not prevent this from occurring. Two observers with "
"different background knowledge can legitimately hold different beliefs about"
" the same event. In short, where the frequentist view is sometimes "
"considered to be too narrow (forbids lots of things that that we want to "
"assign probabilities to), the Bayesian view is sometimes thought to be too "
"broad (allows too many differences between observers)."
