"After having demonstrated the beneficial effect of repeated-measures-"
"designs on the standard error of mean, we conduct a t-test for paired "
"samples. Using this test, we compare whether the number of mischieveous "
"acts has increased after receiving a cloak of invisibility (variable "
"``Cloak``) in comparison to the number of mischieveous acts at baseline "
"(variable ``No_Cloak``). This analysis is described in chapter 10.9.3 of "
"Field (2017), especially Figure 10.12 and Output 10.8 - 10.9. We use the "
"same data file **Invisibility RM.sav** which can be downloaded from the "
"`web page accompanying Andy Field's book "
"<https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e/student-resources/datasets>`__."

"In jamovi, do we go further down in the input panel and tick ``Mean "
"Difference`` and its ``Confidence interval`` underneath. We, furthermore,"
" tick ``Descriptives`` to obtain a output that is similar to SPSS. "

"The results from SPSS and jamovi are identical, but they are arranged "
"slightly differently. SPSS gives the mean difference (blue box) first, "
"before giving the t-statistics and their respective degrees of freedom "
"and p-value (red box), in jamovi it is the other way round (statistics – "
"red box – first and mean difference – blue box – afterwards). Another "
"table underneath (green box) gives the descriptive statistics for the two"
" variables that were compared. Except from that jamovi also reports the "
"Median, and a slightly different way to arrange the columns (SPSS begins "
"with the ``Mean`` and has the ``N`` afterwards, jamovi vice versa) the "
"two tables are identical. The numerical values for the statistics are "
"identical: *t* = -3.804, *df* = 11, *p* = 0.003."

"SPSS, in addition, gives the ``Paired Samples Correlation`` (which one "
"typically would not report). To obtain such table, one would have to use "
"``Analyses`` (tab) → ``Regression`` → ``Correlation Matrix`` and assign "
"the variables ``No_Cloak`` and ``Cloak`` to the variable box."
