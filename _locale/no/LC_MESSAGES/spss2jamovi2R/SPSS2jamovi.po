"Quite a few of us are so used to SPSS that we are a little scared to switch "
"to another software because such transition and to get acquainted with a new"
" software always takes time and effort. Now might be a good time to switch "
"because SPSS is also introducing a `new interface "
"<https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/2017/10/23/newuipreviewspss>`__"
" with version 26 which at least requires getting used to something new and "
"learn it. Why not take a little bigger step and learn jamovi? jamovi does "
"not entail the high `license costs <https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-"
"statistics/pricing>`__ of SPSS (from $ 99 / month for the Base Package) and "
"can be a first step on the road to R. jamovi tries to use an interface that "
"is relatively similar to the one in SPSS, the result version is more "
"transparent and can be easily transferred to text processing (copy-and-paste"
" with [mostly] keep formatting)."
