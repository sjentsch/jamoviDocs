"To add to a ``LayoutBox`` in a grid format, use the ``cell`` property of the"
" child control. As the ``LayoutBox`` is positioning its ``children`` it will"
" use the ``cell`` property of the control to place it correctly. The "
"``cell`` property of a child control overrides the auto positioning of the "
"``style`` property. If a child control does not have a ``cell`` property "
"defined it will use the ``style`` property to automatically place it based "
"on the position of the previous child."
