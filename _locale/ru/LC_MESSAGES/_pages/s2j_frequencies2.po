"This comparison shows how a loglinear analysis is conducted in SPSS and "
"jamovi. The SPSS test follows the description in chapter 19.9.2 in `Field"
" (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially figure 19.7 and"
" output 19.7 - 19.10. It uses the data set **Cats and Dogs.sav** which "
"can be downloaded from the `web page accompanying the book "
"<https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e/student-resources/datasets>`__."
