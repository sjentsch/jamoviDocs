"Analyses can be selected from the analyses ribbon or menu along the top. "
"Selecting an analysis will present an “options panel” for that particular"
" analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts "
"of the analysis, and select different options. At the same time, the "
"results for the analysis will appear in the right “results panel”, and "
"will update as you make changes to the options."

"When you have the analysis set up correctly, you can dismiss the analysis"
" options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the options panel. If "
"you wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that "
"were produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or "
"say, a colleague) created earlier."

"If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove it"
" with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results "
"will bring up a menu, and by selecting ``Analysis``, and then ``Remove``,"

"jamovi produces nice APA formatted tables, and attractive plots. It is "
"often useful to be able to copy and paste these, perhaps into a Word "
"document, or into an email to a colleague. To copy results, right click "
"on the object of interest, and from the menu select exactly what you want"
" to copy. The menu allows you to choose to copy, say only the image, or "
"the entire analysis. Selecting copy, copies the content to the clipboard,"
" and can be pasted into the other program in the usual way."
