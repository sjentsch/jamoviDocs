"There are a few ways to use jamovi and R together. The first is to use of"
" the `Rj Editor <Rj_overview.html>`__, a module available from the jamovi"
" library that allows executing R code from within jamovi."

"Another is to use the :doc:`jmv R package <jmv_overview>` which makes all"
" the analyses included with jamovi available from an interactive R "
"session (such as in RStudio). jamovi can also provide the equivalent R "
"syntax for each analysis with :doc:`Syntax mode <um_6_syntax_mode>`."

#~ "To learn more about R you can "

#~ " J. Navarro <https://djnavarro.net>`__. The "

#~ " <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>`__ and has "
#~ "psychology students who use R in "
#~ "their first method course as the "
#~ "main target group. On this page "
#~ "you will find a `PDF "
#~ "<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf>`__ and a"
#~ " `bookdown <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/>`__ "
#~ "version that was the basis for "
#~ "«Learning statistics with jamovi» (which "
#~ "is availble both as `web documentation"
#~ " <https://lsj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lsj/Prologue.html>`__ "
#~ "as well as `textbook in PDF format"
#~ " <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__). The "
#~ "second resource, `R for Psychological "
#~ "Science <https://psyr.org>`__, is still under"
#~ " construction and more aimed at "
#~ "someone who already has taken at "
#~ "least one research method class and "
#~ "would like to learn how to use "
#~ "the R programming language in their "
#~ "own work. This site also has a "
#~ "strong focus on the `tidyverse "
#~ "methodology <https://www.tidyverse.org>`__ of "
#~ "`Hadley Wickham <http://hadley.nz>`__."
