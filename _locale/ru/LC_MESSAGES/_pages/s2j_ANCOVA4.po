"This comparison shows how an analysis of covariance which excludes the "
"covariate is conducted in SPSS and jamovi. The SPSS test follows the "
"description in chapter 13.6.1 - 13.6.4 in `Field (2017) "
"<https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially figure 13.5-13.7 "
"(Excluding the covariate in figure 13.5 and ``Options`` in figure 13.7) "
"and output 13.5. It uses the data set **Puppy Love.sav** which can be "

"In SPSS, you can find the adjusted values of the group means in the "

" are any changes in happiness levels if there is an increase in puppy "
"exposure. The ``Tests of Between-Subjects Effects`` table shows the sum "
"of squares for the dose of puppies, and this tells us how many units of "
"variance this factor accounts for. In the ``Contrast Results (K Matrix)``"
" table, level 2 (15 mins) is compared with level 1 (control) and then "
"level 3 (30 mins) is compared with level 1 (control). Here, the group "
