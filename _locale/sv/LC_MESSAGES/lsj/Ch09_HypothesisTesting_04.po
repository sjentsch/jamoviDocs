"Okay, we’re very close to being finished. We’ve constructed a test "
"statistic (*X*) and we chose this test statistic in such a way that we’re"
" pretty confident that if *X* is close to *N* / 2 then we should retain "
"the null, and if not we should reject it. The question that remains is "
"this. Exactly which values of the test statistic should we associate with"
" the null hypothesis, and exactly which values go with the alternative "
"hypothesis? In my ESP study, for example, I’ve observed a value of *X* = "
"62. What decision should I make? Should I choose to believe the null "
"hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis?"

"To answer this question we need to introduce the concept of a **critical "
"region** for the test statistic *X*. The critical region of the test "
"corresponds to those values of *X* that would lead us to reject null "
"hypothesis (which is why the critical region is also sometimes called the"
" rejection region). How do we find this critical region? Well, let’s "
"consider what we know:"

"It’s important to make sure you understand this last point. The critical "
"region corresponds to those values of *X* for which we would reject the "
"null hypothesis, and the sampling distribution in question describes the "
"probability that we would obtain a particular value of *X* if the null "
"hypothesis were actually true. Now, let’s suppose that we chose a "
"critical region that covers 20% of the sampling distribution, and suppose"
" that the null hypothesis is actually true. What would be the probability"
" of incorrectly rejecting the null? The answer is of course 20%. And, "
"therefore, we would have built a test that had an *α* level of 0.2. If we"
" want *α* = 0.05, the critical region is only *allowed* to cover 5% of "
"the sampling distribution of our test statistic."

"The critical region associated with the hypothesis test for the ESP "
"study, for a hypothesis test with a significance level of α = 0.05. The "
"plot shows the sampling distribution of X under the null hypothesis "
"(i.e., same as :numref:`fig-samplingDist`). The grey bars correspond to "
"those values of X for which we would retain the null hypothesis. The blue"
" (darker shaded) bars show the critical region, those values of X for "
"which we would reject the null. Because the alternative hypothesis is "
"two-sided (i.e., allows both θ < 0.5 and θ > 0.5), the critical region "
"covers both tails of the distribution. To ensure an α level of 0.05, we "
"need to ensure that each of the two regions encompasses 2.5% of the "
"sampling distribution."

"As it turns out those three things uniquely solve the problem. Our "
"critical region consists of the most *extreme values*, known as the "
"**tails** of the distribution. This is illustrated in :numref:`fig-"
"rejectionRegion1`. If we want *α* = 0.05 then our critical regions "

" we should reject the null hypothesis. The numbers 40 and 60 are often "
"referred to as the **critical values** since they define the edges of the"

"A very brief digression is in order at this point, regarding the word "
"“significant”. The concept of statistical significance is actually a very"
" simple one, but has a very unfortunate name. If the data allow us to "
"reject the null hypothesis, we say that “the result is *statistically "
"significant*”, which is often shortened to “the result is significant”. "
"This terminology is rather old and dates back to a time when "
"“significant” just meant something like “indicated”, rather than its "
"modern meaning which is much closer to “important”. As a result, a lot of"
" modern readers get very confused when they start learning statistics "
"because they think that a “significant result” must be an important one. "
"It doesn’t mean that at all. All that “statistically significant” means "
"is that the data allowed us to reject a null hypothesis. Whether or not "
"the result is actually important in the real world is a very different "
"question, and depends on all sorts of other things."
