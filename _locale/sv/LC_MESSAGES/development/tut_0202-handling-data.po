"So far in these tutorials, we haven’t really examined what the "
"``self$data`` data frame *actually* contains. It contains the data from "
"the dataset which is displayed in the spreadsheet view, but exactly how "
"these values map to the R type system is a bit nuanced."

"``Nominal Text`` variables only ever have ‘text’ values, so will come "
"through in the ``self$data`` data frame simply as factors. ``Continuous``"
" variables only ever have numeric values, so in the ``self$data`` data "
"frame, they are of type numeric. However, the ``Nominal`` and ``Ordinal``"
" variable types are a little more tricky. These can have *both* numeric "
"*and* text values."

"Further, there are situations where you want to treat a ``Nominal`` or "
"``Ordinal`` variable as a factor (i.e. when it is used as the grouping "
"variable for a t-test), but other times where you want to use it as a "
"number (i.e. when taking a mean of say, Likert items). (Some would argue "
"that this should never happen – you should never be taking the mean of a "
"categorial variable, and that’s possibly true – but some people do still "
"find it useful)."

"The other advantage of the ‘dual nature’ of ``Nominal`` variables, is "
"that it means the users can ignore the variable type if they don’t want "
"to worry about it. When working with large datasets, the process of going"
" through and setting up all the columns, making sure they have the "
"correct variable type, etc. can be long and tedious. So only using the "
"variable type as a guide can make it easier for the user. This is also "
"consistent with the way that many statistical software work, including "
"SPSS."

"So whether a ``Nominal`` variable should be treated as a factor or a "
"continuous variable should be determined by context. For example, for an "
"ANCOVA, variables assigned to ‘factors’ should be treated as factors, and"
" variables assigned to ‘covariates’ should be treated as numeric. Avoid "
"*inferring* how the user wants to treat the variable based on its type, "
"i.e. avoid an ‘independent variables’ option, where if the user assigns a"
" nominal variable, it is treated as a factor, and if the user assigns a "
"continuous variable, it is treated as a covariate – this is *implied* "
"behaviour, and users make mistakes."

"In jamovi, by default, ``Nominal`` and ``Ordinal`` variables in "
"``self$data`` come through as factors. The numeric values for each column"
" are attached to the column as an attribute. You don’t need to interact "
"with this attribute directly, but there are situations where it’s good to"
" know it’s there."

#: ../../development/tut_0202-handling-data.rst:63

"One issue to do with these attributes, is that a number of R functions in"
" the ``base`` package have no respect for attributes. Using the functions"
" ``na.omit``, ``subset`` and likely others on ``self$data``, results in "
"the discarding of these attributes. For this reason, it is better to "
"convert these columns to the types you want to use (so the attributes are"
" no longer needed) *before* using these functions."

"To convert a ``Nominal`` or ``Ordinal`` variable (which come through as "
"factors) to a numeric, ``jmvcore`` provides the ``toNumeric()`` function."
" To convert in the other direction, from a numeric to a factor, you can "
"use the ``factor()`` or ``as.factor()`` functions built into R. If "
"``toNumeric()`` is called on a variable which is already numeric, it has "
"no effect. Similarly, if ``as.factor()`` is called on a variable which is"
" already a factor, it has no effect. So you can call these on every "
"column, without needing to check whether they are already the correct "
"type."

"Returning to our ANCOVA example, which requires a single numeric "
"dependent variable, one or more factors as factors, and one or more "
"covariates as numeric, we might begin the ``.run()`` function as follows:"

msgid ""
"In this way, one of the first things you will do in the ``.run()`` "
"function, is setting up all the columns from ``self$data`` to be the "
"correct types."
