#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:70
msgid ""
"In the past, we’re had a number of difficulties with dependency resolution "
"for jamovi modules. Sometimes jmvtools would install more dependencies than "
"were necessary, and other times not enough. This stemmed from contamination "
"of the R library path, from R packages installed on the system. In this "
"release we’ve successfully isolated the system libraries from the jmvtools, "
"and only the required dependencies will now be installed."

msgid "*Improvements to .u.yaml files*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:80
msgid ""
"Previously, .u.yaml files (the UI definition) were automatically generated "
"from .a.yaml files (the analysis definition). This was sometimes problematic"
" when additional changes were made to the .a.yaml files. It wasn’t always "
"clear which changes should be propagated to the .u.yaml files, and which "
"should not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:86
msgid ""
"In the 0.7.3, the .a.yaml and .u.yaml files work together. The .u.yaml file,"
" by default, contains minimal information (mostly just describing the "
"layout), and the property values, for example labels, are taken directly "
"from the .a.yaml file. For many people, they will only need to edit the "
".a.yaml file, and jmvtools can take care of the .u.yaml file itself. More "
"documentation for UI Design will be coming soon."
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:93
msgid ""
".u.yaml files using this new scheme will have the ``jus``, near the top of "
"the file, specified as ``2.0``. .u.yaml files using the older ``jus`` of "
"``1.0`` will be automatically upgraded. Upgraded files will be placed in "
"``tame`` ``compilerMode`` (explained next), you may want to change it to "
"``aggressive``."

#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:101
msgid ""
"jmvtools also introduces a new option in .u.yaml files: ``compilerMode``. By"
" default, .u.yaml files are created in ``aggressive`` mode. This means that "
"jmvtools will take a heavy handed approach when updating the .u.yaml files. "
"If new options are added to the .a.yaml file, it will aggressively add them "
"into the .u.yaml file, overwriting any manual changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:108
msgid ""
"In contrast, the ``compilerMode`` of ``tame`` does not overwrite manual "
"changes in the u.yaml. The trade off is that it often can’t position UI "
"elements as optimally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../development/developer-hub.rst:112
msgid ""
"We recommend beginning with your .u.yaml files in ``aggressive`` "
"``compilerMode``, and when you begin to refine your UI by adding custom "
"changes to your .u.yaml files swap over to ``tame`` ``compilerMode`` so that"
" your changes are preserved. Again, for a lot of people, ``aggressive`` mode"
" will be all that they will ever need."

"For the time being, changes to the .a.yaml and/or the .u.yaml files, will "
