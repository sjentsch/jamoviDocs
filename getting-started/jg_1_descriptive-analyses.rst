====================
Descriptive analyses
====================

| How to perform descriptive analyses and create graphs in jamovi:

#. | Select ``Analyses`` → ``Exploration`` → ``Descriptives``.

   |select_descriptives|
   
   | 
   
#. | Drag and drop the variables you want descriptive analyses for to
     ``Variables``.  

   |add_var_descriptives| 

   | 
   
#. | The result is shown in the right panel. Right-click on the output
     to save or copy it.

   |output_descriptives| 

   | 
   
#. | To split your descriptive analyses on a categorical variable (e.g. to
     separate by gender), move that variable to ``Split by``.

   |add_var_descriptives_groupby|

   | This changes how the output looks like:

   |output_descriptives_groupby|

   | 
   
#. | Click the ``Statistics`` tab to see more alternatives.

   |select_descriptives_statistics|

   | 
   
#. | To create a plot based on the above choices, click the ``Plots`` tab and
     tick the box of your desired plot. If you would like to identify outliers
     and to check whehter your variables conform with a normal distribution,
     then you should tick ``Box plot``, ``Violin``, and ``Q-Q``. 
     
   |select_descriptives_plots|

   | For those, aiming to stretch even further to an in-depth introduction, you
     can read the respective chapter in the “Learning statistics with jamovi”
     `web documentation <../lsj/Ch04_Descriptives.html>`__ or chapter
     4 of the `e-book <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__.
