msgid "To test the equality of the variance with the Levene test, open the ``Assumption Checks`` drop-down menu and set the ``Homogeneity test`` tick box. It is also a good idea to check that the variances at the different steps of the repetition factor are the same (Sphericity). To do so, open the ``Assumption Checks`` drop-down menu and set the ``Sphericty tests`` tick box."
