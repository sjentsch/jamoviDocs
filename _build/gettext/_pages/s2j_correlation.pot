msgid "This comparison shows how a Pearson’s correlation is conducted in SPSS and jamovi. The SPSS test follows the description in chapter 8.4.1-8.4.2 in `Field (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially figure 8.7-8.8 and output 8.1. It uses the data set **Exam Anxiety.sav** which can be downloaded from the `web page accompanying the book <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e/student-resources/datasets>`__."

msgid "In SPSS, Pearson’s r is found both underneath and over the diagonal, while in jamovi the coefficient is only shown underneath. This makes it much easier to find relevant information from the output in jamovi. The numerical values for the statistics are identical: *r* = 0.40, *p* < .001; *r* = -0.71, *p* < .001; *r* = -0.44, *p* < .001."
