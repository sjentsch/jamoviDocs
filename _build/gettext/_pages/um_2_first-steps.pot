Additionally, there are a number of example data sets available in jamovi. To open a file, select the file menu (☰, at the top left hand corner of jamovi), select ``Open`` and then ``Data library`` or ``This PC``, depending on whether you want to open an example, or a file stored on your computer."

msgid "A very common format for exchanging data is using files with “comma- separated values” (.csv or .txt). Given that these data are stored as simple text file using commas (or \";\", \"|\", etc.) to separate values nearly any software package can read and write them (and you to can take a look using any text editor). An example is shown in the figure. The first line contains the variable names and any other line afterwards a measurement point (typically a person where data were acquired from). If you have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g., Excel), you can create a CSV-file from your data by selecting ``File`` → ``Save as...`` and choose ``Comma delimited`` in the drop-down menu close to the ``Save as``-button. Thereafter, you may open the CSV-file in jamovi."
