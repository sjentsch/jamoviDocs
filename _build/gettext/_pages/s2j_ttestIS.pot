msgid "This comparison shows how a t-test for independent samples is performed in SPSS and jamovi. How the test is conducted in SPSS follows the description in chapter 10.8 of `Field (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially Figure 10.4 and Output 10.3 - 10.4."

msgid "In SPSS, ``Mischevious acts`` is moved to the variable box ``Test variables(s)`` and ``Cloak of invisibility`` to variable box ``Grouping variables``. Afterwards, press the button ``Define Groups...`` (underneath the variable box ``Grouping variables``) and enter ``0`` under ``Group 1`` and ``1`` under ``Group 2``."

msgid "In jamovi, the variable ``Mischief`` is moved to the variable box ``Dependent Variable(s)``, and the variable ``Cloak`` is moved to the variable box ``Grouping Variable``. If you wish to obtain an identical output to SPSS, one has to switch on the Levene's Test for the Equality of Variances, by ticking ``Homogeneity Test`` under ``Assumption Checks``; the table with the descriptive statistics for the two groups can be selected by ticking ``Descriptives`` under ``Additional Statistics``."

msgid "In SPSS, the output table ``Independent Samples T-Test`` starts with Levene's Test for the Equality of Variances. If it is NOT significant (p >   0.05), one can use the results from the first line (``Equal variances assumed``), otherwise, you have to use the results from the second line (``Equal variances not assumed``)."

msgid "If the p-value in the table ``Homogeneity of Variances Test (Levene's)`` is significant (p < 0.05), then you have to correct for that inhomogeneity. To do so, untick ``Student's`` and tick ``Welch's`` instead (under ``Test`` in the input panel). The results described underneath can be found in the first table ``Independent Samples T-Test``."
