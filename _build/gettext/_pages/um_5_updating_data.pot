msgid "Once a data set is set up with filters, computed variables, transforms and analyses, sometimes you may want to update the data. This may be for a number of reasons – It might be that you have a new data set, that you want to apply the analyses you performed earlier to it, or you may be conducting an experiment where you’re tesing a number of participants, and you now have an additional participant’s data to analyse. By importing into an existing data set you can re-run your analyses without having to re-perform all of your data cleaning and analysis steps (making your jamovi files behave a bit like scripts)."

msgid "It is also possible to import multiple files at once. This can be useful when you are combining multiple data sets, for example, where each file represents a participant. The process is the same as the single-file import detailed above, except that you select multiple files when performing the import. You can do this by holding down control or shift when selecting data files, or with the “multi-select” button at the top of the import dialog."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/um_5_updating_data.rst:50
msgid "When importing multiple files like this, they are combined vertically with the rows of the second file appearing below the first, the rows of the third file appearing below the second, and so on. An additional column called ``source`` is created detailing which file each row has come from. This can be useful when you need to “split-by” or “group-by” each participant. This column can be particularly useful to use with the ``group_by`` argument to ``V``-functions described above."

#: ../../_pages/um_5_updating_data.rst:63
msgid "Templates in jamovi are special data sets that are analagous to script files in more traditional statistical environments. They are a way to specify data types, computations, filters, transforms, and analyses in advance. Once the data becomes available, it can be imported into the template, and the template will update accordingly. The nice thing about jamovi templates is that they are entirely specified with the familiar user interface, and do not require working with a “syntax” or code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/um_5_updating_data.rst:71
msgid "To save a data set as a template, select ``Export`` from the file menu, and select ``jamovi template (.omt)`` from the file type box. When opening a template, you’ll see it contains columns but no rows, and that all the analysis results are blank. To use the template, import a new data set (or data sets) using the file import described above. The data will update, followed by the filters, computed variables, and finally the analysis results."
