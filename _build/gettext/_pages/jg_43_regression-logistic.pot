msgid "Logistic regression can be found by selecting ``Analyses`` → ``Regression``. If the outcome variable is nominal (as in the above image), select ``2 Outcomes`` if it has 2 steps / different values, or ``N outcomes`` if it has *more* than 2 steps. If the outcome variable is ordinal (e.g. low, medium, high), select ``Ordinal Outcomes``."
