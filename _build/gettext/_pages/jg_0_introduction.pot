msgid "The aim of the following section is to provide short, non-technical tutorials on how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi. It was originally created by Jonas Rafi under the name jamovi guide. However, it is meant to be an introduction, not a resource providing an in-depth introduction into the background of those procedures. For such an endevaour, there are plenty of other resources. Some of these resources are listed at the bottom of the pages introducing the individual analyses in the box “Community resources”."

msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/jg_0_introduction.rst:54
msgid "The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that examines how the impact of one or more factors affects an outcome (dependent) variable. These factors are the predictor variables and are categorical. Typically, such factors reflect an experimental manipulation (e.g. with or without treatment), but a factor can also represent groups for whose influence one would like to control (e.g. gender: men or women). The analysis of variance is based on a concept similar to that of the t-test, but it goes beyond that, in that factors can have several levels (t-tests only allow two) and in that several factors can be examined simultaneously."

msgid "Correlation and regression analyses are statistical methods for assessing the relationships between a dependent / outcome variable and one or more independent / predictor variables. While the *correlation* analysis examines the *relationship* between one predictor and one outcome variable, *regression* analysis mainly focuses on *prediction* (how well can one or more variables predict another (outcome) variable). Often, a distinction is made between linear and non-linear (e.g., logistic regression)."
