msgid "``jmv`` is available from CRAN (a central repository for publicly available R-packages). To install jmv, open an interactive R session (e.g. RStudio) and type the first line (the >-mark at the begin of the line is the input-mark of R and must not be copied / typed). The package ``haven`` is required if you want to read or write SPSS, SAS or Stata files and can be installed using the second line. If you want to read and write `jamovi <https://www.jamovi.org>`__'s omv-files you can use the package ``jmvReadWrite`` which is installed using the third line. Finally, the package ``jmvconnect`` permits to access data sets that you currently have opened in `jamovi <https://www.jamovi.org>`__."
