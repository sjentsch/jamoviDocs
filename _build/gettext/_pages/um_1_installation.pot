msgid "At some institutions (particularly universities), the “normal” approach to installing software is blocked by IT security policies. In this case, you can download our .zip version. To use this, simply download, unzip to a location on the computer, and naviagate to the bin folder. Double-clicking jamovi.exe will begin jamovi. It’s possible that additional security restrictions prevent jamovi from working in this way, in which case it would be worth raising the issue with your IT staff."

To install it, download the .dmg file from our `download page <https://www.jamovi.org/download.html>`__, and double-click the downloaded file. This will present you with a “file view”, and you can install jamovi by “dragging-and-dropping” the jamovi application to the Applications folder (in the usual way). After this, jamovi will appear in your applications, and can be started like any other installed application."
